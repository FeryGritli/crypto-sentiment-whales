I would just prefer to do it separately to my account as I have my set up and plan each month there. Does anyone have any ideas on a simple way to do this? 

Or is it just easier to buy them a ledger too, use the same account and purchase and transfer it each month as normal?

2025-07-23 12:52:48,"Why you should only sell if you can retire. A warning to new Crypto investors! Hello, guys I wanted to make this post to save any new investors from suffering from the fear of not selling. As I got into crypto in 2024 I’ve done so much research it’s exploded my mind. Owning Bitcoin, XRP, XLM, HBAR, XDC, QNT, Solana, and Dogecoin. 

With a really large bag since investing. I’m upwards to $140K now invested. So I have a lot to lose and likely will lose profit when the bear market hit’s as I’m holding for 10 years. I wanted to warn of reddit as they are trying to push the norm to take profits this year. I’ll lay out why that’s a big mistake unless you can retire. 


As I’ve read many story’s of when Solana was $0.45 cents. Or Bitcoin was $100 dollars. Or XRP was $0.04 cents I’ve noticed one thing after reading dozens of dozens of reddit posts. If these people had simply held their bags for 10 years they would have been millionaires or multi-millionaires. 

Seriously, it never fails from me reading horror story’s of investors on here who had 8000 solana at 0.45 cents only to sell it all when it went to $8-$15. It’s far more common than you think. 

As I’ve done my research one of the biggest and worse advice I’ve seen from crypto reddit’s is the attack on XRP. XRP recently moving to $3.50 and has shown these Crypto warriors don’t know what they’re talking about. As I’ve seen dozens and dozens of posts saying XRP would never hit $1.

Next they’ll be attacking XLM after it breaks $1. The fact that every one of these utility driven crypto’s have multiplied substantially over the years is why you shouldn’t sell if it can’t retire you. You will still go to work Monday. 

Trust me on this google search horror story’s of profit takers selling to early and getting priced out, or selling for profit and years later finding out there bag could have made them millionaires. All they had to do was hold. The crypto industry has proven long term patience always pays off. Think 5-10 years. 

I’ve a paid off house. Paid off cars. And I save about $48K a year. So I’m in a far different position than a lot of you to get my bag back fast. But at the same time profit taking makes no sense in crypto considering many of you could possibly be priced out or miss an even bigger all time high. 

With the possibility of a bear market coming which we know it is you also underestimate the possibility we could go on a full blown utility run. 

To sell these assets when you’ll not even walk away with $200K in profit is a huge mistake. Be careful of what you see. I can assure you more millionaires have been made by holding their crypto long term 5-10 years vs those who keep selling. Even the millionaires and billionaires who have lost their wallets by actions of their own stupidity. 

In the next five through ten years anyone holding Bitcoin at 0.2 percent, XRP at 5000-10000, XLM at 50,000-100,000, HBAR at 50,000-100,000, Solana at 400-800, QNT at 30, Dogecoin at 100,000, and many of other utility driven coins outside of those will be Multi-millionaires.

It's undervalued by any metric. By the time any thesis is popular most of the profit has been made. Privacy coins are so low compared to other market segments & it's the original Cypherpunk ethos. Satoshi would approve. 

\--------------------------------------------

  
**""This is not financial advice and just my personal analysis. Please do your own research.**

I simply share my analysis of why I think that Zcash (ZEC) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

It's also not meant as input for short-term trading, I'm not interested in that and I think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

# Starting point

Bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken Saylor could spend.

The narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (SoV) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space/) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

The launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF [IBIT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7B AUM is considered the most successful ETF launch *in history*.

The U.S. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**Nothing stops this train.**

That means number go up for Bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. With gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the S&P500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

Ethereum and Solana have both been underperforming Bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

Retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) recently raising $500M in 12 minutes. Or $600M, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

Crypto Twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much Bitcoin is pumping. Retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on X.

# A privacy renaissance?

Meanwhile, the word on the street is that AML regulations are getting out of control. It's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

People have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

Interacted with a mixer six years go? Please explain yourself.

The EU is leading the way again in regulation with MiCA, the only area where the EU seems to be leading these days. This lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

# Why should privacy coins outperform?

I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin has been institutionalized. Bitcoin Maxis are cheering for Michael Saylor, ETFs, and even strategic Bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the Bitcoins in the reserve. Or the ones from whom the Bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

There are various L2 solution trying to add privacy to Bitcoin, I'll write in another post why I don't think these will add privacy to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. I hope I'm wrong, though, and projects like [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [Cashu](https://cashu.me/) get mainstream adoption.

The problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

Swapping Bitcoin for Monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, Monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while Bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

So was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

Will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

# Will Bitcoin dominate forever?

As I said in the beginning, Bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and Bitcoin got it.

The only thing that Bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good L1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. We can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. It's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the L1 protocol layer, given the ossification of Bitcoin.

Currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): The leading privacy coin Monero has only \~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, Zcash, only \~1/3300th.

So why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? Why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

It's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually Monero, over Bitcoin. [Archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetyp_Market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was Monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250M Euro in revenue.

So why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? And while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. Why should that change?

* The market cap of Bitcoin is $2.3T
* The market cap of gold is $22T
* Total global asset value is [\~$1,000T](https://x.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1919385198795338165)
* That is, the market cap of Bitcoin is \~1/10th of gold and \~0.2% of total assets
* The market cap of all privacy coins ([CoinGecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4B
* The market cap of Monero is $6B
* The market cap of Zcash is $0.7B
* Undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10T, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
* That is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than \~0.1% of offshore wealth**

Due to increasing AML regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

Quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. That's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. This will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider DeFi ecosystem.

Another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

All the KYC & AML regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

Users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the Ledger email leak that happened years ago.

So hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

# Zcash vs. Monero

As has been argued in [another post](https://frankbraun.org/t-addr), Zcash has better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of ZEC in circulation are currently in shielded pools. That's quickly increasing due to the ""Zashi effect"" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [Keystone](https://keyst.one/). Ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

Holding ZEC in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for ZEC. It's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

Monero currently has the lead over Zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare Zcash shielded transaction to default Monero transactions. At least until FCMP++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of FCMP++ over zero-knowledge proofs.

# The importance of UX

Monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while Zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. Assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but I want to share an observation I made over the years.

Open-source has been really effective in delivering superior ""base layer"" infrastructure components: The Linux kernel, the GCC compiler, various programming languages, etc.

But it's usually very bad at delivering world-class UX, these usually come from companies, Apple being the most famous example.

I think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great UX. Nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great UX needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

Given that Zcash currently has the better base technology (Monero is catching up with FCMP++), the war for the end user is won in the UX, and there [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/) under Josh Swihart is currently leading the way with [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

The typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great UX and already has a Ledger.

# Privacy is necessary for commerce

Most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. Using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

The term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: Making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

You can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is.

For example, there is good reason why a lot of HR departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. If you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

Bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like GDPR) exist for a reason. I'm not a lawyer, but I would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**Commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

Just as the World Wide Web (using the HTTP protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to HTTPS) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. See also: [Zcash, the HTTPS of Blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in January 2020).

And while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

For a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

# Halvings

Zcash is about two halving cycles behind Bitcoin. While inflation in Bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in Zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of \~12.5% to \~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in November 2024. This might serve as a catalyst for Zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

The next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely \~2%.

And after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub \~1%.

Bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. Zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. But from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

# Tracking

Of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. But picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

* BTC: 118844.42 USD
* XMR: 334.72 USD
* ZEC: 44.23 USD

Let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

# Conclusion

If the network effects of Bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both Monero and Zcash should underperform Bitcoin.

If privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both Monero and Zcash should overperform Bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising \~80% of it (according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

Given that Zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of Monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making UX advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both Monero and Bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

Which is why I consider Zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**It has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** Holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. It's a great flywheel.

The largest risks I see is that Monero quickly catches on with FCMP++ and better UX, or that the recent quick UX advances in Zcash slow down. For example, due to lack of funding for Electric Coin Company, because recent [changes to the Zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ECC doesn't automatically receive ""protocol funding"" anymore.

Commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

I guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

Until then — stay safe out there anon!""

When future fusion reactors print gold as a by-product of energy the gold supply will increase. The Bitcoin supply won't even if they try to use that energy to mine it. 

The most creative part of Satoshi's invention was arguably the addition of the difficulty adjustment to ensure that the Bitcoin supply schedule would stay on track even in the face of changing mining hashrate due to high Bitcoin demand or an abundance of energy. It's a mechanism that sets Bitcoin apart from most other supply/demand systems. 

Obviously the production of gold from fusion at scale is nowhere near reality (and the produced gold will be radioactive for 14 years), but it's an interesting thought experiment nonetheless. ",0.8309

# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/) 
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit.
* Moons can be tipped to others on both the rcryptocurrency Telegram and Discord.

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days. The Moon Week 64 post should be live soon!

# Let's talk Moon Week 63 and 64 Moon Burns:

Between May 29th and July 20th

* 3,994 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in nineteen unique burn events:
* 72,843 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in twenty unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 52 day period is: 76,837 Moons.

*(Moon Week 65 is already off to a hot start with almost 100K moons burned between Arb One + Nova in the first 2 days. Those burns will be included in the breakdown of next updates total numbers)*

\----------

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

On Arbitrum One, with \~637k Moons having been burned to date. Currently worth a combined $69,175.

*Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the purpose of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to engage with rCC users.*

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~3.06M Moons having been burned to date. Currently worth a combined $332,310.

2025-07-22 20:08:37,"$GROOKROOMS seemed highly fishy according to AI How I got here: I don’t trade or engage in cryptocurrencies. I was checking out the grookroom experiment project about AI echo chambers, then I found this community seems to be talking about cryptocurrency instead of the experiment.

It has turned into an meme coin trading center.

This I asked Grok AI what is happening (which I’ll skip for now and put it at the end).

In summary, there is a likelihood that they are just using the experiment as a hook to get people in buying this coin, with potential financial scheme.

Link to the coin: https://www.bitmart.com/trade/en-US?symbol=GROKROOMS_USDT

 The AI listed very suspicious trends of the currency, I was hoping if someone can check it out and confirm the findings:

- **Extreme Volatility:** 31,000% price surge in 24 hours (July 21, 2025), reaching $4.5M
market cap, followed by consolidation at $0.0018, signaling potential pump-and-dump risk.

• **Overbought Indicators:** Close-Relative
Strength Index (CRSI) hit 100 (""danger zone""), indicating overbought conditions prone to sharp corrections.

• **Whale-Driven Activity:** Large investors (whales) accumulated tokens to fuel the surge, with some selling into pumps, raising concerns about market manipulation.

• **Lack of Utility:** No clear fundamental value or project roadmap, relying on Al branding and hype, increasing risk of rug pulls or abandonment.

• **FOMO and Social Hype:** “Off the charts"" social sentiment on X and Telegram, driven by influencers and viral posts, mirrors patterns of unsustainable pumps.

|

If it really is a dangerous scam, can someone report it to the relevant authorities?

I’m not really knowledgeable in cryptocurrency, so I’ll hope someone more experienced will make the report.

I simply hope to prevent harm being done to others, but if anyone has a problem with that then okay…

Here is further context of what is happening in the community:

- **$GROKROOMS Meme Coin:** The community has pivoted heavily into the cryptocurrency space, with $GROKROOMS emerging as a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Recent posts on X highlight explosive price action, with the token reportedly surging over 31,000% in a single session, reaching an all-time high market cap of $4.5 million before consolidating above $1.5 million.

- **Speculative Frenzy:** The price surge is driven by intense speculative trading, fueled by whale activity (large investors accumulating and sometimes selling off during pumps), influencer hype, and FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail traders.
Social sentiment on X is described as ""off the charts,"" with community channels buzzing and influencers amplifying the narrative.

- **Technical Signals and Risks:** Technical indicators like MACD suggest short-term bullish momentum, but the coin's Close-Relative Strength Index (CRSI) is in the
""danger zone,"" signaling overbought conditions and potential for sharp reversals.
Warnings about insider activity and classic meme coin volatility are circulating, indicating high risk.

In contrast, the BCH chart shows a price of $515.74 with a 29.90% increase, but a lower peak of $641.06, and a significant 25.88% drop from its all-time high.

2025-07-22 19:46:06,"Justin Sun just deposited 50K ETH to an exchange, and it’s probably not a random move 

About 13 hours ago, a wallet linked to Justin Sun withdrew 50,000 ETH (~$190.95M) from Aave and deposited the entire amount directly to HTX.

This isn't the first time. In total, he has now transferred over 116,810 ETH ($444.83M) to exchanges, making this the largest ETH deposit to an exchange from a single entity in recent history.

Which raises a few important questions:

Is this a planned exit?
A liquidity reshuffle with HTX?
Or something else entirely?

His average entry price seems to be around $3,000, meaning he’s currently sitting on about +25% in unrealized profit, not even counting staking or restaking rewards. Technically, this could be a perfect level to start taking profit, but it's also possible he’s positioning for something bigger.

What adds another layer is a recent report from Bitget, stating that over 90% of ETH addresses are currently in profit, the highest level since December 2024.

So now the question is,

Its time to share your biggest crypto blunders. Whether its stolen crypto, lost in a trade, sold too early, etc…Let it out here and suffer with your bros.

I’ll start:
I got into crypto in 2017 as literally the entire top 50 was starting to run (IIRC ETH to $50-70). My trade thesis was simple: “what hasnt pumped yet?” did about a days worth of research and subsequently dumped $20k into XRP. First got in about $10k in at 0.006 cents and it pumped to like 7cents a week later. Bought another $10k on the retrace back to 2.5cents. 

Held thru the 2018 short lived pumped to $3. Didnt sell a penny. Blockfolio said $6mm.

Held thru all the way until SEC sued Ripple and that shook me to the core. Couldnt hodl after that and sold. I still came out in significant profit from my initial capital. Took a few hundred $k’s out over a few months, put back into BTC and ETH before the 2021 run up.

Somehow made it back to $2.5mm. Held. Lost mostly all of it on the dump into bear market.

Started the current cycle with very few wins. Started dabbling in shit coins, memes, etc... Long story short, im down to 4-figures in crypto. While i got way more out of the market than what I put in, its still devastating. 

How much would I have if I just held XRP until today? $8mm. Thats beyond life changing for me. I would’ve changed lives of not only my immediate family but many relatives and very close friends. 

Yes, it fucking hurts.

2025-07-22 14:48:53,"The dichotomy of an idiot These are my two primary trading accounts, CDC and CB. I primarily purchased on CDC during the runup of last bullrun, and held like a demented toddler. 

For my CB account I purchased some on the run up, and most during the bear market following last bull, namely around 2023. It essentially became my meme coin account vs my mainstream addoption account.

It's harrowing to see how much of a scamcoin CDC had become and how much faith I put into it and the company, versus something like SOL which I watched from the sidelines run 15$ to 250$ in 2021, or ETH which id heard about from a minecraft mod in 2012ish.

Ive gotten back in to do some DD on the other meme coins I'm suffering heavy losses with, and im struggling to find reasons on why they would stop lagging and join the current bullrun. Coins like VET, POLY, ALGO, and MANA are hard to have faith in right now as it seems they have no position within the market or ecosystem.

Of the 17 new tokens listed on Bitget in July, one token achieved a 10x return on investment (ROI), while six others saw gains of over 3x as of July 18. 

The analysis indicates that despite the number of winning trades being roughly equal to losses, the average return was approximately 2x.

2025-07-22 14:10:39,"EVM Everywhere, But What About SVM? Been thinking a lot about the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) lately. It doesn’t get talked about as much as the EVM, but the performance difference is wild super low latency and high throughput, which is why Solana can handle so many transactions without choking lol

What’s interesting is that now we’re seeing projects trying to bring that SVM level performance into more modular environments. One that caught my eye is Eclipse it’s a Layer 2 that runs on the SVM but breaks things up modularly (execution, settlement, data availability). They’re also using ZK proofs to handle computation off chain, which makes the whole thing a bit more scalable.

Feels like a different take compared to most L2s sticking to EVM. Still early, but I’m curious to see where projects like this go. Recently they got a bitget listing as it was official on twitter handles. 

Question is how fast are we adopting and developing our cryptocurrency with SVM ?

Based on a survey of 4,599 crypto wallet users conducted in early 2025, the report highlights that **gaming (36%), daily purchases (35%),** and **travel bookings (35%)** are the top categories where users express the strongest interest in paying with crypto. 

The results point to a demand for practical, day-to-day applications of digital assets in both online and offline environments. this comes days after Bitget listing of **Yooldo Games (ESPORTS)** in the Innovation and GameFi Zone, a multi-chain Web3 gaming platform backed by key players like Consensys and Linea...

The report captures preferences across generational cohorts. 

* **Gen Z (aged 18–29)** shows strong interest in social and entertainment-driven use cases, including gaming and gifting. 
* **Millennials (30–44)** express more diversified use across travel, subscriptions, and digital goods. 
* **Gen X (45+)** favors high-value or essential categories such as travel (40%), digital products, and real estate. 

This distribution reflects the need for flexible and secure crypto payment experiences tailored to different life stages and priorities.

*""Crypto payments are no longer a fringe behavior — they're becoming embedded in how people transact across regions and age groups,""* said **Jamie Elkaleh, CMO of Bitget Wallet**. 

*""What users are asking for is reliability, compatibility, and control. Whether it's a QR code at checkout or a stablecoin-powered purchase online, the expectation is that spending crypto should feel as seamless as spending cash.

2025-07-22 01:51:58,"The Machinery of Freedom Must Be Built This struck a nerve. What we all came for isn't being built on transparent blockchains (Bitcoin) or the smart contract platforms. Thought I would share - this guy is worth a follow. [https://x.com/arjunkhemani/status/1936110545695871239](https://x.com/arjunkhemani/status/1936110545695871239)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few months ago, I read Peter Thiel’s The Education of a Libertarian. One line from that piece has haunted me ever since:

“The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.”

What is that machinery of freedom?

In the same post, Thiel warns against a seductive delusion:

“The future of technology is not pre-determined, and we must resist the temptation of technological utopianism — the notion that technology has a momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world.”

He’s right. Progress isn’t automatic. Technology doesn’t have agency. There’s no law of history that guarantees a freer or more prosperous future.

David Deutsch offers the clearest definition of wealth I’ve encountered: wealth is the repertoire of physical transformations one can cause. In other words, progress means expanding what we can do. That expansion comes from creative effort and error correction—from the feedback of nature in science and the feedback of markets in society.

But that only works in a free environment.

Without freedom, knowledge creation slows. Markets break. Progress stalls. To prevent that, we need tools that protect freedom from political interference.

That’s the machinery Thiel was referring to. And the most important component of that machinery is money.

Before the invention of money, trade was conducted through barter. Societies had to match wants directly. Economists call this the problem of the lack of double coincidence of wants. Even though, in principle, anything could be traded for anything, the sheer friction in matching needs made most trades impossible.

Introducing a single good as a medium of exchange (money) solved this. Suddenly, prices could be expressed in a common denominator. And with prices came the possibility of large-scale cooperation. Prices are signals. They convey knowledge about human preferences across time and space, much as language conveys thought. This is what makes civilization-scale coordination possible.

But those signals can be corrupted. And they have been… again and again.

Throughout history, tyrants have tried to override economic reality by distorting prices. They debased currencies, fixed exchange rates, inflated supply—anything to assert political control over what is, fundamentally, an emergent and decentralized system.

Fiat money is a political artifact. It’s fragile, opaque, and prone to abuse. It punishes savers, rewards insiders, and weakens the market’s immune system. It makes capitalism unsafe.

Bitcoin was invented to solve this. With a fixed supply and decentralized issuance, it offered a credible alternative to fiat. But Bitcoin is not private. And privacy isn’t optional for individuals who seek freedom.

During the 2022 Canadian trucker protests, the government invoked emergency powers and froze transactions from 34 crypto wallets (including 29 Bitcoin addresses). The problem wasn’t technical but architectural. Bitcoin’s transparent ledger made censorship easy. If the state can see everything, it can still enforce compliance through physical coercion.

So what is the machinery of freedom that can make the world safe for capitalism?

It’s the next evolution of money—Satoshi’s Last Wish: money that is decentralized, private, and scalable. Money that can’t be surveilled or stopped. Money that makes freedom non-negotiable.

Zcash is already the most advanced implementation of this vision. It offers strong cryptographic privacy, proven over nearly a decade. And now, with Project Tachyon, it’s being re-engineered to scale to billions of users without sacrificing privacy.

The timing couldn’t be more urgent. AI surveillance, CBDCs, and authoritarian overreach are accelerating. Wrench attacks are rising. The window is narrow. But the opportunity is real.

Money is upstream of everything—science, education, energy, even morality. If you don’t fix money, nothing else can scale. If you do, infinite frontiers await.

Progress needs freedom. Freedom needs machinery. That machinery must include private, uncensorable money.

The future isn’t guaranteed. Someone has to build it.

2025-07-21 16:36:43,"Joint Donation Drive: r/CryptoCurrency & r/EthTrader Unite to Defend Roman Storm – and Crypto’s Future Hey r/CryptoCurrency 

We’re joining forces with r/ethtrader for a community-driven donation drive to support the legal defense of Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash. This isn’t just about one developer — it’s about defending privacy, open-source development, and the very principles that make Ethereum and crypto possible.

# Why This Matters

Roman is facing years in prison for publishing open-source privacy software — tools anyone could freely use. At the time, the only official guidance (from FinCEN) said developers of such software weren’t money transmitters. Yet in August 2023, U.S. authorities arrested him, charging conspiracy, unlicensed money transmission, and sanctions violations.

The DOJ’s narrative misrepresents the facts:

* Roman and his co-founder ""never operated a service"" — they only published code.
* They added filters in their web wallet code to block sanctioned addresses but couldn’t control forks of their software.
* The prosecution hinges on a ""novel legal theory"": that ""money transmission"" applies even without custody of funds.

This case sets a dangerous precedent: if developers can be punished for misuse of open-source code, innovation and privacy in crypto are at risk. The First Amendment protects code as speech — yet prosecutors treat it like an afterthought, even resorting to absurd analogies (comparing money transmission to ""a frying pan conducting heat"").

# The Situation Now

Roman’s trial began July 14, 2025, in Manhattan. What was expected to last 2 weeks may now stretch 3-4, with skyrocketing costs for expert witnesses, research, and legal fees. The defense fund urgently needs ""another $1.5M"" to sustain the fight.

The Ethereum Foundation has stepped up with ""$500K"" and will ""match community donations up to $750K"" — doubling your impact.

# How You Can Help

Visit [https://freeromanstorm.com](https://freeromanstorm.com/) to donate. Options include:

* ""Juicebox"": ETH donations
* ""Giveth"": ETH, L2 tokens, SOL (no fees)
* ""We Want Justice DAO"": Fiat via wire
* ""Free Roger Ver site"": BTC, BCH, most L1s (no KYC)

2025-07-21 12:17:54,"Why You Should Treat Your Trading Account Like a Business, Not a Casino 
If your crypto trading account feels more like a Vegas weekend than a spreadsheet, you’re doing it wrong.

I’ve YOLO’d into coins because “the chart looked spicy.” I’ve revenge traded after getting stopped out. I once made a 12% gain, thought I was invincible, and gave it all back in 45 minutes trying to chase something called SuperPigToken.

So yeah, I’ve learned the hard way: if you don’t treat your trading account like a business, it will treat you like the customer at a blackjack table. Enthusiastic, optimistic, and ultimately broke.

Every business has structure. There’s a budget, a strategy, targets, and logs. Nobody opens a coffee shop, throws a bunch of beans in the air, and says, “Let’s see what happens.”

But crypto traders do that every day.
No plan. No risk management. No reason other than a green candle and some guy on YouTube whispering “breakout.”

A real trader treats their capital like inventory. You don’t want to waste it on bad setups or trade it emotionally just because you “haven’t won in a while.” That’s like restocking expired milk because you're mad nobody bought it the first time.

Would you invest in a company that doesn't track profits or losses?

No?
Then why run your trades without a journal?

Even a basic spreadsheet with columns like entry/exit price, size, why you entered, what went wrong/right, and how you felt can completely change the way you trade.

Once I started journaling, I realized I wasn't losing because of ""market manipulation."" I was just entering way too early and using size that made me sweat bullets on every red candle.

If you're not tracking, you're not learning, you're just donating.

If you run a business and lose some product in shipping, you don’t freak out and close the shop. You log it. You learn. You tighten the process.

Same with trading. A bad trade doesn’t mean you suck. It just means that, like every business, some investments don’t return as expected. The goal is manageable risk, not perfect outcomes.

High leverage with no stop loss is basically walking into a bank and saying: “I have a great idea, but I need all the money now, and I won’t tell you what I’m doing with it.”

If you're risking 50% of your account on one trade, you’re not trading , you’re spinning a wheel and hoping the ball lands on your number.

Businesses scale up slowly. They invest cautiously. And they definitely don’t burn everything on a hunch.

I’m not saying don’t have fun. Trading is exciting. But if you’re serious about growing your money, you need to stop playing and start operating.

Have a plan. Manage risk. Keep records. Treat your capital with respect. Get better, not luckier.

Because if you don’t take your account seriously, the market will happily take it from you.",0.4395

I, somewhat curiously, introduced myself to her and we chit chatted for a while. We were never more than friends. This was about 2019. The pandemic happened and we lost our jobs. I was job hunting online in everything I could find that was marketing related. I happened to see a job position at a centralized exchange that needed a Russian native speaker or a Ukrainian native speaker. Luckily she is both. I sent her the job posting and then I said to her, ""If you need to, I can teach you about crypto and how it works and you should be good to go."" So we met up a couple more times to explain everything to her and she landed the job.                

About a year later she was let go, then she found another job at a centralized exchange and asked me to write a letter of recommendation. So I did. She landed that job too. Then the war in Ukraine happened. I can't say for certain, but I would imagine that she was able to send money to her family using crypto when necessary.                  

Fast forward to 2023. I tied the knot with my wife and gave her about 500 USD of bitcoin at the time. I told her, ""Only sell it if we need to take care of an emergency like paying for a family member's suddenly unexpected surgery."" It tripled since then. She trusts me to use it as a long term savings vehicle.",0.8447

I know a lot of people have moved over to DEXs for the whole ""not your keys, not your coins"" philosophy, but I’ve personally stuck with CEXs for most of my trades and here’s why:

1. Liquidity & Speed – CEXs still win when it comes to deep order books and faster execution. I’ve tried swapping mid-cap tokens on DEXs and sometimes it’s a slippage nightmare or you’re waiting forever for a good fill.
2. UI/UX matters – Platforms like Binance, Coinbase Pro, or Levex have a way smoother user experience. DEXs are getting better, but sometimes they still feel clunky, especially when you’re managing multiple wallets and chains.
3. Fiat on/off ramp – This one’s huge for me. I can deposit/withdraw fiat easily with CEXs. Most DEXs don’t handle that, so you’re always hopping between platforms anyway.
4. Security through accountability – I know this might sound weird given all the CEX hacks we’ve seen, but major exchanges do have insurance and are regulated to some extent. With a DEX, if you fat-finger a trade or get caught in a scam token, you're pretty much on your own.

Now I do keep a bag or two on-chain and I love the autonomy that DEXs offer. But for serious trading, I still lean centralized.

2025-07-20 22:36:19,"How Hyperliquid is Rewriting the Rules of Capital Allocation # The Greatest Buyback Experiment in Private Equity History: How Hyperliquid is Rewriting the Rules of Capital Allocation

**In an era where Apple's $110 billion buyback barely moves markets and private equity firms struggle with record-long holding periods, a decentralized exchange has quietly orchestrated the most revolutionary buyback program in financial history.**

While traditional markets celebrated another record-breaking year of corporate buybacks—with S&P 500 companies returning $942.5 billion to shareholders in 2024—a different kind of experiment was unfolding in the digital asset space. Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, has created what can only be described as the greatest buyback experiment in the history of private equity: a fully automated, revenue-driven capital recycling engine that makes traditional buyback programs look antiquated by comparison.

# The Magnitude of the Machine

Hyperliquid's Assistance Fund has amassed more than $1 billion in HYPE tokens, creating a major capital recycling engine where 97% of the fees collected from users are used to buy back HYPE. To put this in perspective, the platform recently purchased $4.72 million worth of HYPE in a single day, with an average price of $47.43, while maintaining strong buyback mechanics of $2 million per day.

This isn't just impressive—it's unprecedented. When we examine the scale relative to the platform's size and age, Hyperliquid's buyback intensity dwarfs anything seen in traditional private equity. The platform has accumulated over $77 million in USDC inflows to its Assistance Fund, with over $25 million in the past month alone, translating to an average daily buyback of approximately $1 million worth of HYPE.

# Beyond the Numbers: A New Paradigm

What makes Hyperliquid's approach revolutionary isn't just the scale—it's the mechanism itself. Unlike traditional private equity buybacks that depend on discretionary board decisions, market timing, and complex approval processes, Hyperliquid operates like a protocol-funded participant, always bidding, always buying.

Using an average contract trading fee of 0.0225%, with profits distributed between HLP and AF in a 46:54 split, approximately 54% ($18.79 million) enters the AF fund to buy back HYPE, translating into an annualized net profit of $225.5 million. This creates what amounts to an auto-scarcity mechanism that not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity, creating additional upward pressure on token price.

# The Private Equity Context

To understand why this matters, consider the current state of traditional private equity. The median holding period for a private equity-backed company reached an all-time high of seven years in 2023 but experienced a dramatic decline in 2024 to 5.9 years, while private equity firms hold more than 28,000 assets, 40% of which have been held for longer than four years.

Traditional private equity struggles with what economists call the ""liquidity paradox""—the longer you hold assets, the more difficult it becomes to achieve efficient exits. Firms are sitting on record amounts of dry powder while facing prolonged holding periods that frustrate limited partners and distort returns.

# The Hyperliquid Solution

Hyperliquid has solved this paradox through what could be called ""perpetual liquidity generation."" Rather than waiting for exit opportunities, the platform creates continuous value through its buyback mechanism. The automatic nature of the Assistance Fund's buyback activity, directly fueled by protocol revenue, creates a transparent and programmatic link between the platform's operational success and mechanisms designed to support the token's value.

This approach mirrors the best practices of traditional private equity—focusing on operational excellence and cash generation—while eliminating the industry's biggest weakness: exit dependency. Every day of successful trading activity translates directly into buyback pressure, creating what Doug Colkitt, founder of Ambient Finance, calls alignment between ""a project's tokenomics and user incentives regardless of prevailing market conditions"".

# The Performance Proof

The results speak for themselves. Hype has soared to an all-time high of $42 and is up 65% in the last month, beating Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. More importantly, the Assistance Fund is sitting on a trove of $680 million in paper gains after buying Hype tokens at an average price of $14.

Hyperliquid's futures trading volume has continued its upward trajectory, recording $443 billion year-to-date in 2024, with November alone seeing a record-high trading volume of $77 billion, capturing an impressive 45% market share in the crypto futures DEX market. This organic growth, combined with the buyback mechanism, creates a virtuous cycle that traditional private equity can only dream of achieving.

# Why This Changes Everything

Traditional private equity operates on a model of buy, improve, and exit. This creates inherent tension between value creation and value realization. Hyperliquid has created a fourth option: buy, improve, and continuously compound through systematic buybacks.

The implications extend far beyond crypto. By purchasing and burning HYPE tokens from the market, supply contracts, and the proportional value of remaining tokens naturally increases. This auto-scarcity mechanism not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity.

This model addresses three critical challenges facing modern private equity:

**1. The Exit Bottleneck:** Rather than depending on IPO markets or strategic buyers, value is continuously realized through buybacks.

**2. The LP Patience Problem:** Instead of waiting years for distributions, token holders see continuous value accretion through supply reduction.

**3. The Scale Efficiency Question:** The more successful the platform becomes, the more aggressive the buybacks become, creating exponential rather than linear value creation.

# The Broader Revolution

Other crypto projects like Jupiter and dYdX have similar plans, with estimates suggesting various protocols will repurchase hundreds of millions worth of tokens annually. But Hyperliquid stands apart in both scale and execution sophistication.

Hyperliquid stands apart from the rest of the ecosystem, with no true direct comparison. The project's development has been entirely self-financed, fostering organic and sustainable growth. The revenues generated by the protocol are among the highest in the industry and are entirely reinvested into HYPE buybacks through the Assistance Fund.

# The Future of Capital Allocation

What we're witnessing with Hyperliquid isn't just a clever financial engineering trick—it's the emergence of a new paradigm for capital allocation that could reshape how we think about value creation and distribution in private markets.

The traditional private equity model, with its dependence on external exit markets and discrete liquidity events, suddenly looks as antiquated as dividend-paying utilities in a world of growth stocks. Unlike dividend models, where scarcity is contingent on individual reinvestment decisions, Hyperliquid's automatic burn system reinforces the network's tokenomics without relying on user behavior.

# The Bottom Line

While Apple makes headlines with $110 billion buyback announcements and private equity firms struggle with extended holding periods, Hyperliquid has quietly built the most sophisticated capital recycling machine in financial history. It's not just the largest buyback experiment in private equity—it's the blueprint for how capital allocation should work in the digital age.

The question isn't whether this model will be copied—it's how quickly traditional private equity will adapt to remain relevant in a world where automated, performance-linked buybacks have redefined what efficient capital allocation looks like.

In an industry built on the promise of superior returns through operational excellence, Hyperliquid hasn't just delivered—it's created a new category entirely. This isn't just the greatest buyback experiment in private equity history; it's the beginning of private equity's next evolution.

At face value, this would seem to be hard for the issuer or buyer to make money. He sells $1 million in coins to people, puts the $1 million in a safe account earning some low percent interest rate, and the end users who bought the coin can't speculate like bitcoin that these coins will go up in value, since they are $1 each. It seems they could only be used for sending money, like a gift card. The only way they could make money is if the the issuer gave a discount, or promised future 'dividends'. Is this legal? The issuer could give a discount based on a portion of the interest they expect to receive.

It would seem that a company could instead, if it normally kept $2 million in cash to cover operations year to year, issue say $1.5 million in stablecoins, sell them at a discount, collect the millions, put them into risky investments with high rates of return, and count the cash to cover operations as the cash to cover the stablecoin instead.

This would allow the company to take riskier, expansionary bets, which might be good for the economy, until there is bad news, and the company has to pay their stablecoins off due to a run, and does not have enough money for operations, and goes under.

Under bankruptcy, the new law favors the stablecoin owners, so the stock owners and commercial lenders are left out and will end up failing.

In a financial crisis, this might lead to a vast amount of collapse. Is there anything I am not understanding about this?",0.9474

2025-07-20 19:27:40,"GENIUS Act - CLARITY Act - ASS Act Alright, folks, grab your popcorn and settle in for a masterclass in American financial sleaze, where the U.S. government, drunk on its own dollar-printing power, is trying to pull a fast one on the world with stablecoins to dodge its $36 trillion debt disaster!!

This isn’t some nerdy crypto trend...it’s a caustic, in-your-face con to keep the world footing the bill for America’s economic mismanagement, all while waving shiny new laws like a used car salesman pushing a lemon. 

The U.S. has spent decades printing fiat money like it’s Monopoly cash, forcing everyone from Tokyo to Timbuktu to swallow the inflation through the petrodollar and dollar-trading stranglehold.
Now, with a debt pile that could buy a small planet, they’re scheming to shove that debt into stablecoins...yes you heard it right!! They're planning to shift the debt disguised as Digital dollars backed by U.S. Treasury bills...it would have been okay except that it's being done without so much as a courtesy call to the world that’s been buying their IOUs in the form of treasury bills!! 

Let’s break down this scam in plain, sarcastic English, exposing how three new laws are the backbone of this hustle, each with a con as blatant as a fox guarding the henhouse. 

For years, the U.S. has run the global finance game like a casino where they’re the house, and everyone else is forced to play.

They print dollars like there’s no tomorrow, funding wars, tax breaks for billionaires, and corporate bailouts, while the rest of the world eats the inflation. 

Every time they crank up the printing press, your groceries in Mumbai or gas in Berlin get pricier, all because the dollar rules oil and trade. 

The world’s been strong-armed into buying U.S. Treasury bills government IOUs to keep this racket going, and now those IOUs total a mind-boggling $36 trillion. 

That’s what happens when “fiscal responsibility” is just a punchline in Washington. But the world’s getting fed up with buying America’s debt and many Nations now have sidetracked to trading in their own currencies...so insecure U.S. is now pivoting to stablecoins—crypto coins pegged to the dollar, supposedly backed by T-bills.

It's like promising your kid a dollar for every candy they buy, but you’re borrowing the cash from their piggy bank. The catch? They’re pushing three laws to make this happen, each one a slick move to keep the debt machine humming while the world’s left holding a potentially worthless bag of digital coins!! 

First up is the GENIUS Act—Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, because nothing says “genius” like dressing up a debt trap as progress. This bill, which breezed through the Senate in June 2025 with a smug 68-30 vote and is poised to charm the House, forces stablecoin issuers to back every digital buck with T-bills or other “safe” assets, puts big players under Federal Reserve oversight, and throws in some anti-money-laundering rules to look responsible. Sounds like they’re protecting you, right? Think again. The con is as obvious as a shady landlord demanding you pay rent in gift cards! 

By mandating T-bill backing, the U.S. is creating a massive new market for its debt ,think $1.5 trillion in stablecoin demand soon, maybe $4 trillion in a decade, out of a $6 trillion T-bill market. Companies like Circle ($63 billion in USDC) and Tether ($159 billion in USDT) are already buying T-bills like they’re on sale, and this law will rope in more, like JPMorgan or even Trump’s sketchy World Liberty Financial with its $2.2 billion USD1.

What's funny is If these stablecoins crash—like TerraUSD did in 2022—you’re left with worthless digital coins, while the U.S. already cashed out on its debt sales!! 
It’s like lending your buddy $100 for a “sure thing” investment, only to find out he spent it on beer and you’re stuck with an IOU!! 

Next, we’ve got the CLARITY Act, or the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is about as clear as mud. Part of the July 2025 “Crypto Week” dog-and-pony show, this bill sorts out whether cryptocurrencies answer to the SEC or CFTC, making it easier for companies to dive into crypto without drowning in red tape. Yes, they've eliminated bureaucracy and the House is ready to rubber-stamp it, with crypto bros like Coinbase cheering from the cheap seats!! 

But here’s the con, as blatant as a car dealer selling you a “low-mileage” clunker with a rolled-back odometer. By making crypto seem safe and investor-friendly, the U.S. lures more players—Visa, Mastercard, maybe even Amazon—into issuing stablecoins, all of which need T-bills to back them!!

That’s more debt the U.S. gets to sell without the world’s approval, propping up its $36 trillion mess while pretending it’s just “modernizing finance.” If those stablecoins tank, users like you lose everything, but the government’s already pocketed the cash from T-bill sales. It’s like buying concert tickets from a scalper, only to find out the show’s canceled and he’s long gone.

Then there’s the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which sounds like a patriotic stand against Big Brother but is really just another debt dodge. 

This bill bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ...a government-run digital dollar...because why take responsibility when you can outsource the risk? 

Guess what!! Both sides of the  House loves it, with crypto-friendly lawmakers high-fiving each other for “protecting freedom.” The con here is as slick as a door-to-door salesman pushing fake Rolexes. 

By blocking a CBDC, the U.S. pushes private companies like Circle, Tether, or Trump’s USD1 to flood the market with stablecoins, all backed by—you guessed it—T-bills. 

This lets the government rake in billions from debt sales while private firms and their users take the hit if things go south. 

Picture lending your neighbor your lawnmower, only for him to sell it and leave you mowing with a pair of scissors. If a stablecoin collapses, users are screwed, but the U.S. already got its debt funded, sipping coffee while the world scrambles.

This whole stablecoin push is America doubling down on its dollar monopoly, using crypto as a shiny new wrapper for the same old scam. 

The GENIUS Act creates the debt pipeline, the CLARITY Act drags in more suckers, and the Anti-CBDC Act ensures private companies carry the risk while the U.S. keeps borrowing.YIPEE YAY!!

Companies like Circle, Tether, JPMorgan, and even Trump’s World Liberty Financial are jumping in, buying T-bills to back their coins and fueling America’s spending spree. The House’s blessing on these bills is like signing a blank check for the government to keep dodging its $36 trillion debt, while the world—stuck holding stablecoins faces the fallout if the system crashes. 

It’s not innovation; it’s a hustle to make everyone else pay for America’s mistakes, all while they smirk and call it progress. So, next time you hear about stablecoins saving the economy, check your wallet—the U.S. is probably already picking your pocket!!

I do think at that time it would have been something hardware based so assume if I worked on some clues I could find old sata mechanical drives and start doing some digging. I do get the weird feeling I could log in via a client or website to see how it was getting on my phone then also have a weird memory of having to be part of a pool… again this may be mixed up memory’s.

Circle’s Dante Disparte says the GENIUS Act ensures tech giants and banks can’t dominate the stablecoin market without facing strict structural and regulatory hurdles.

The GENIUS Act contains a little-noticed clause that prevents technology giants and Wall Street behemoths from dominating the stablecoin market, according to Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte.

“The GENIUS Act has what I’d like to call — just for my own legacy sake — a Libra clause,” Disparte [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYbFDxA1ho8) the Unchained podcast on Saturday. Any non-bank that wants to mint a dollar-pegged token must spin up “a standalone entity that looks more like Circle and less like a bank,” clear antitrust hurdles and face a Treasury Department committee with veto power over the launch.

Banks don’t get a free pass either. Lenders that issue a stablecoin must house it in a legally separate subsidiary and keep the coins on a balance sheet that carries “no risk-taking, no leverage, no lending,” Disparte noted.

That structure is even “more conservative” than the deposit-token models JPMorgan and others have floated. “It creates clear rules that I think in the end the biggest winners are the US consumers and market participants and frankly the dollar itself,” he added.

# GENIUS Act passes with bipartisan backing

Passed last week [with more than 300 House votes](https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-heads-donald-trump-signing-what-will-change), including support from 102 Democrats, the [Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/genius-act-how-it-could-reshape-us-stablecoin-regulation) gives the dollar “rules-based” firepower in the global digital-currency race, Disparte argued.

“Crypto is finally getting what it wanted: legitimization, a path for legal and regulatory clarity in the United States and an opportunity to compete,” he said.

The bill preserves the patchwork of state money-transmitter laws for issuers under a $10 billion threshold but demands a national trust-bank charter once assets breach that level.

Notably, the law bans interest-bearing stablecoins, pushes rigorous disclosure standards and introduces criminal penalties for unbacked “stable” tokens. Terra-style experiments are “gone,” Disparte said.

However, critics argue the ban on yield could stunt consumer adoption and hand an advantage to overseas issuers. Disparte claimed that yield “is a secondary-market innovation” better delivered by decentralized finance protocols once the base layer is rock-solid.",0.669

Bitcoin isn't physical. It's just entries on a giant digital ledger. The value isn't in a coin you hold, but in the agreed-upon record that says you own it. Just like the Rai stones, where the stone stayed put but everyone knew who it belonged to now.

2025-07-19 17:29:59,"Don't get got. Tips to avoid losing your money. This is mainly a reminder to myself, but maybe this helps some newer people too.

With all this crypto hype dragging in fresh blood again, here’s a little guidance to help avoid screwing yourself over.

* **Hold that shit**: If you actually believe your coin’s got long-term value: **JUST HOLD**. Ignore the noise and don't sell unless some *real* bad news drops (Key partners exit, serious exploit, insolvency, lost legal challenges, etc). Even then, the price will likely climb back up unless it's some irrecoverable problem or it was just a rug-pull crypto in the first place.
* **Do some damn research**: Look up reasons why your crypto of choice has value, what its downsides are, etc. Is it because Logan Paul hyped it up, or is it because the team behind it have are *actively* and *visibly* working on a bigger plan? Find that shit out first before putting money in it.
* **Resist FOMO**: Seems obvious, but when you see a price start climbing like crazy, your first impulse is to ""BUY NOW"", but don't. Wait for the next dip. There will ALWAYS be a dip. The whales make the most money off the FOMO.
* **Volume is key**: Has the volume been steadily climbing, or did it jump up out of nowhere with no news behind it? If it just jumped out of nowhere, don't buy. Wait.
* **Be aware of market depth**: Some platforms give you a graph, others just show the DOM (Depth of Market)

Below are walls. When they get hit, the price will likely drop some. People that are unaware of this might think the price is tanking and will sell.  If there is enough upward momentum, these mean nothing.

[This is what causes that saw tooth pattern you usually see as a price goes up. It doesn't mean the price is tanking, but it does mean its going to fluctuate. Especially if the price has steadily been trending up. Same goes for the inverse when price is trending down, but spikes of green appear. ](https://preview.redd.it/hni1205r6vdf1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b88f3ca97dfb79910c6834b2334f6a82dbd886)

# If you still want to trade/scalp/whatever, know this:

You are playing a game rigged against you. Big players that wipe their ass with a million bucks are out here setting traps daily. Those traps are mainly against other players, but a lot of smaller fish get caught in it too. Their sole mission is take your money by preying on **impatience** and **emotion**.

# Common traps

**Stop-hunts**

* Price spikes into obvious stop zones (recent highs/lows), then sharp reversal.
* Watch for long wicks near key levels

[$3650 was a key point and it hit and tanked giving the whales a chance to buy even lower. Most drops like this have nothing to do with actual sentiment, just emotion and manipulation. ](https://preview.redd.it/qltc5y797vdf1.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=8781569903e6b2c2e22b73a4369f4dc9c19925f8)

**Fake/False breakouts**

* Price blasts through resistance/support briefly, then dumps/pumps opposite.
* Low volume around it? Weak momentum? Probably fake.

[AKA Bear\/Bull traps. Some differences, but basically the same thing](https://preview.redd.it/16a0s54u7vdf1.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d821814814a334c474a214768ffb7c280605f4b)

**Spoofing**

* Big buy/sell walls suddenly appear and disappear from the order book.
* Persistent orders matter, fleeting ones are likely bait.

(*Hard to find a good example of this from past data, but just be wary of sudden things popping up and disappearing*)

**Fake pumps**

* Big green candle out of nowhere, no real news, thin volume around it = exit liquidity trap.
* Volume must back the move or it’s suspect.

[Very low volume around and then a big bump all of a sudden, followed by price dropping. ](https://preview.redd.it/6m2j5a698vdf1.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d6c178e216f321395b0b6f19a92078c4bbbb62f)

# Summary

* You can’t out-trade whales; they thrive on impatience and retail emotion
* Real breakouts have real volume and continuation
* No volume = no conviction = high risk of trap.
* If you really believe, just hold - but if you trade, don’t chase the first move

Stay sharp. This market isn't designed for us little folk.",-0.9932

2025-07-18 23:22:30,"I’ve been buying Hex since 2021… And it’s forever gone down.

I am pure degenerate.

I believe this coin has the legs to run, the community to support it, and the founder to bootstrap it.

I believe Richard Heart moved the 80k BTC.

I believe when he said he mined 300k BTC in 2011 back when he live-streamed in 2019 era.

I believe we will see the most epic pump after Eth tops.

I think the hex community has received the most hate and ridicule, but throughout everything, they are still here and believe harder than ever that Richard Heart made the best crypto products (and is still making them…. Liberty finance . Swap)

I’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what Richard Heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.

1) Bitcoin.  People wanted to earn yield, so they gave their Bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  Guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their BTC.  Guess who warned you of Gemini, Celcius, FTX, etc?  Richard.

He actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in December 2019.  Which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.

So this guy Richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  Meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  Just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  

The money used to buy ASICs, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  A hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.

So hex is born.

2) Ethereum.  Best product that crypto has offered.  Period.  Bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  It can’t do sheet.  Ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  

But them gas fees yo.  Every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.

Hence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  It’s not some L2 that is centralized on one dudes node.

It’s world wide. No one can turn it off.  And it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.  So now Ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while Pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  Best of all worlds.  

Pulsechain is born.

3) Uniswap.  Did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  There’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but Hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  All UNI token holders are getting kucked.

So Richard made PLSX.  Buy and burn features TURNED ON, and cannot be turned off.  It’s the drunken michael Saylor buying the PLSX token forevermore with every swap that occurs on Pulsechain. 

With $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, AND everybody hates the chain.  Imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…


So these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  But Richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.


RH believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.

What other meme coin can boast such stats?

I like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  Freedom to transact.

2025-07-18 11:57:24,"What would be the best network for HODLing USDC? Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on the best network to **HODL USDC**. I want to build a long-term reserve of USDC, and I already have a **hardware wallet**, which gives me great security for my private keys. However, I'm really torn about which network to use for storing my USDC.

After some research, I understand that keeping USDC on the **Ethereum network** would likely be the most secure option, given its unparalleled robustness and decentralization. The downside, though, is the significantly higher cost for sending and moving funds on Ethereum. This makes it quite unattractive for smaller amounts, especially during peak times like a **bull market**, when gas fees can skyrocket.

A promising alternative I've been considering is storing my USDC on **Polygon**. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Polygon offers much lower transaction fees and faster confirmations.

My main question is: Does the added security of Ethereum justify the high costs for a long-term reserve, or would the practicality and cost-effectiveness of Polygon be an acceptable compromise, especially since I'm already using the protection of a hardware wallet?

I'd really appreciate your insights on this balance between cost and security for HODLing USDC. What's your recommendation? Thanks in advance!",0.9827

I've been 'in crypto' for 6 years or so, basically have no profit in total, despite reading so many books, watched so many yt videos, testing so many 'theories'. I should have bought 6 years ago and hold it until know, then the gains would have been great, but didn't and always tried to 'play the market'. 

Basically it goes like; little win, little win, little win, yes it goes great and then huge loss due to crashing market, usually because some mf* tweeted something.

The last few months I've only had little gains and playing very safe. But keep 'missing out' on the gains. Like now I thought LTC would definitely stop at 102 and fall back to 98/94/92. When resistance would have been good, i expected it to go back up and continue to 108 or so.

But what happened was, suddenly it continues to 109 and the whole way I keep wondering, where does it stop. And don't buy cause I assume it won't go further so I'm waiting for the resistance, the fall and new floor. 

This is extremely frustrating and can never find any good reasons for why coins keep going up. It's missing out on the moments that matter the most. 

Do some of you here have good ideas or tips? I use Coinglass a lot to keep an eye on the liquidation levels, which can suggest resistances or forced buys that push the price up. But LTC goes up in a area of nothing, even big investers seem to play safe these days. 

Ps. I know crypto is mostly gambling, but little gains due to carefull strategies is a game I enjoy playing with the money I can miss.

Tron has always been associated with shady practices and the general shadiness of Justin Sun. 
 
However it now seems Justin Sun is in with the Trump admin due to large purchases of the $TRUMP token. The SEC has dropped its investigation of Sun. Tron, the company, is going public via a reverse merger with SRM entertainment using Eric Trump’s company.

Tether has a few options though: it can comply with the regulations, withdraw from the US market, or create a new, compliant stablecoin.

I've just come out of a very frustrating meeting in which people who don't really understand crypto (but are keen because they've made gainz) were trying to explain to some people who understood even less  and are highly sceptical. I found myself siding with the sceptics because at least they were consistent!

We had pages of visualisations of blocks and chains and networks but I really don't think this helps the non-techie.

What I think DOES help is when people play around on dApps with MetaMask or similar. I've seen people develop an understanding of self-custody this way.

However, MetaMask requires you to enter a password so it's really difficult for people to understand how that is different from generating a private key, and that MetaMask is doing that generation on your behalf in the browser and not keeping it in their database etc. At this point I chip in saying that you could generate your own key by rolling a 16-sided die 64 times, that you're picking a number from a set almost as large as the number of atoms in the universe etc. And they walk off.

These are the reasons:

1. There are too many tokens. You can't change the laws of physics or economics. There is only a limited amount of money spread to too many tokens.
2. The utility myth has gone. Some day utility tokens will/may have a use but it's not like 2017 with people believing every token will have use in the near future or 2021 when gaming was supposed to be big. Hardly anyone believes in utility tokens nowadays.
3. Retail has been burned too many times. Remember all those noob Dogecoin and Luna investors in 2021? They are scared to make the same  mistake again.

2025-07-17 15:05:59,"The Clarity Act - Likelihood Of Commodity Classification. 

Just asked a LLM to analyse the above.


Navigating the CLARITY Act: Which Blockchains Are Most Likely to Be ""Digital Commodities""

The proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (CLARITY Act) is gaining traction in the US House of Representatives this ""Crypto Week"" (mid-July 2025). This bill aims to bring much-needed regulatory certainty by establishing a clear framework for digital assets — primarily by defining ""digital commodities"" and assigning their oversight to the CFTC.

A core component is the ""maturity test"", which assesses if a blockchain system and its native asset are truly decentralized and utility-driven. It generally looks for:

Decentralization: The system is ""not controlled by any person or group of persons under common control.""

Utility-Driven: The token's value is ""substantially derived from the use and functioning of the blockchain system.""

Broadly Distributed: Ownership by ""certain holders"" must be under 20% of outstanding supply.


I've put together a breakdown of how major blockchain projects stack up, ranked from most to least likely to qualify as a ""digital commodity"" under this framework.


---

🔹 Bitcoin (BTC) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Unquestionably decentralized — no issuer, widely distributed mining and nodes

Clear utility as a store of value and medium of exchange

Fair launch and fixed supply (21M BTC)

Governance is slow, organic, and highly decentralized


Challenges:

Mining pool concentration

ASIC manufacturer centralization (minor)



---

🔹 Ethereum (ETH) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Decentralized validator set post-Merge (PoS)

Multiple, independent clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, etc.)

Essential for DeFi, NFTs, staking — strong native utility

Open governance via EIPs and dev calls


Challenges:

Lido dominance in staked ETH may raise concerns

Historical ICO (but long since matured)



---

🔹 Cardano (ADA) — High Likelihood

Strengths:

Many stake pools; designed for high decentralization

Voltaire era introducing full on-chain governance

ADA used for fees, staking, and smart contracts

Good validator distribution


Challenges:

Past reliance on IOHK (declining as governance matures)



---

🔹 Algorand (ALGO) — High-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Pure PoS allows wide participation

Growing community-driven governance

Utility includes ASAs, fees, and staking

Technically scalable and efficient


Challenges:

Past centralization of relay nodes

Foundation’s large token allocation may trigger scrutiny



---

🔹 Internet Computer (ICP) — Moderate-High Likelihood

Strengths:

On-chain DAO (NNS) governs the protocol

ICP used for computation, storage gas, node rewards

Ambitious goal to decentralize the internet itself


Challenges:

DFINITY Foundation’s role at genesis still lingers

Specialized hardware for node providers may limit diversity

Controversial initial unlock raises ""value from others"" concerns



---

🔹 Hedera (HBAR) — Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Governing Council includes global enterprises (Google, IBM, etc.)

HBAR used for smart contracts, fees, and staking

Gradual roadmap to permissionless nodes

Built with regulatory compliance in mind


Challenges:

Council may be viewed as ""common control""

Initial token distribution favors early insiders



---

🔹 Sui (SUI) — Low-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Unique object-centric design, strong dApp utility

DPoS governance allows community involvement

Used for fees, staking, and governance


Challenges:

High hardware and capital requirements limit validator diversity

Large allocation to Mysten Labs and the Sui Foundation

Risk of perceived centralization and control



---

🔹 Solana (SOL) — Low Likelihood

Strengths:

Extremely fast, low fees, vibrant dApp ecosystem

SOL used for fees, staking, governance


Challenges:

Validator costs are prohibitively high (centralization risk)

Network outages + coordinated restarts = potential control concerns

Dominance of a single client implementation

Large initial allocations to insiders and VCs



---

🔍 Final Thoughts on the CLARITY Act

Final Wording Matters: The bill is still evolving in Congress and may be amended (especially with CBDC bans in play).

Regulator Discretion: The SEC and CFTC will apply the ""maturity test"" case by case.

Ongoing Progress Matters: Projects increasing decentralization, validator access, and community control can improve their chances over time.

If this was asked 3 or 4 years ago i would have said [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) thru their CRO rewards and staking or the Binance thru the ETH 2.0 Staking. or the many profiles that were out there.

Now a days i look at the staking rewards and its too low especially on binance. So what would you guys suggest exploring ?.. is there a platform that can replicate or generate staking rewards.

CRV isn’t the kind of token that runs on hype or meme culture. When it moves it’s usually structure, not noise. And today’s spike doesn’t come with a flashy headline or sudden tweetstorm. No external push, just strong volume inflows and a confident reclaim of key price levels.

What’s interesting is that CRV behavior today mirrors early 2024 breakouts - before DeFi rotation fully kicked in. In those moments, it wasn’t the loudest projects that led - it was the infrastructure ones.

This might be one of those setups where smart capital rotates before the headlines do.

• **Regulatory optimism**: The SEC held a closed-door meeting on July 17, reportedly focused on litigation settlements. Nothing is confirmed, but the timing has sparked renewed speculation that the nearly 5-year Ripple vs SEC case may be coming to an end.

• **Institutional adoption**: Ripple has partnered with Ctrl Alt (UAE) to tokenize **$16B worth of real estate** in Dubai on the XRP Ledger, using Ripple Custody and operating under a DFSA license.

• **ETF narrative**: ProShares is launching the first **2x leveraged XRP ETF (UXRP)** on **July 18**, a move seen by some as a sign of growing institutional interest — and a new gateway for retail traders.

2025-07-17 08:49:16,"The future of crypto? I think the general consensus at this point for AI is that of acceptance, a lot of people have become used to the integration of AI and other technologies alike in our daily life, and although there were a few pushbacks and skepticism at first, it has been incorporated into many industries and ecosystems, including Crypto. 

  
It doesn't take a lot to workout the benefits of the kind of innovations introduced by both tools and projects, think about the insights they provide, as they are able to analyze massive market data and trends to help traders make better decisions. Plus they can actually help execute trade (But a lot of people are still on the fence about this)

  
I've also seen a few AI-based risk engines that help to detect scams, rugpulls, suspicious behaviour early, or even tools like PUMP from Pumpfun that basically allows anyone to create memecoins without the need to know smart contract codes or having a lot of funds to launch a token. 

  
That said, it's not entirely straight forward there are still a lot of tweaks and  orientation to be done, a lot of people view AI mostly from the project perspective (obviously because we're in this for profits) for example I first heard about PUMP's Launchpool before actually reading about its utility. So there's that.

Then again, I might be totally wrong, the future of crypto may have nothing to do with AI integration. ",0.8033

Lopp's blog: https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/                     

I've been trying to tell people that conversations surrounding the Quantum threat are conversations that we need to get comfortable with having. If quantum computing is an actual threat to bitcoin, then it could produce a black swan event. It will get fixed, but the question then becomes ""How much damage would be done?""                  

The proposal Lopp floats is as follows: Some wallet addresses (known as P2PK) will become quantum-vulnerable. These are first-generation bitcoin wallet addresses, including Satoshi's that all begin with ""04."" The proposal is to exclude these from sending transactions in the future by implementing a soft fork now. In this scenario, satoshi's coins are safe, but -here's the problem- anyone who may be storing their bitcoin on such legacy addresses are also excluded from conducting transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.               

He goes over the moral and ethical perspective as well: ""Should a quantum-supreme-entity be able to steal Satoshi's coins even if they have the intention to send them to a burner wallet address?"" **Please note I am paraphrasing and encourage you to read his blog.** What about the guy who lost $600 million USD of bitcoin in that landfill? Is it ethical to recover his bitcoin via quantum computing?                   

Ultimately, I am glad to see that there is **something** of a proposal to fix the problem before it starts, but this binary fix sounds like it will inevitably harm some participants in the bitcoin ecosystem.                 

Discuss!                

EDIT: For those of you who don't know, there are generally four different types of wallet addresses. Addreses that begin with 04 are ""quantum vulnerable"" and so too are P2TR. However, my (perhaps flawed, perhaps wrong) understanding is that a soft-fork later will make P2TR wallet addresses quantum-proof later down the road. Jameson Lopp proposes a completely different soft fork that excludes addresses that start with 04 from participating in transactions. So, in summary, two soft-forks would make bitcoin quantum-proof. **The following is a table to help you determine whether or not your bitcoin wallet is quantum proof.:** https://imgur.com/a/d70kiuB

But crypto isn't stock. I feel like stocks don't just disappear. There's a record/registration and you have to use a broker.

However, with crypto, how do you know whether 50% or btc is on hard drives in landfills (or forgot how to access their wallet) or actually in the ""circulating"" supply.

Basically, when a crypto currency is generated. They create/distribute a lot of currency, normally very cheaply.

Do you see where this is going? Stocks have an official IPO, every sale is registered. Layperson's can't just buy them, and they must be held by a broker. So the 'circulating' supply is relatively easy to know. With crypto, how do you know how much is in the ""actual"" circulating supply?

Like what if the actual circulating supply of BTC is 10% of the BTC supply (per network)?

How should we view market cap vs other metrics?",0.7779

2025-07-16 22:14:04,"What is a Web3 domain? *TLDR; Web3 domains are domains that live on a public blockchain and give users complete ownership of their stored data. The main benefits to owning one are simplifying crypto transactions by replacing wallet addresses with the domain name and easily creating and hosting websites on web3.*

If you haven’t heard yet, web3 domains are the newest kids on the block(chain) and they have the power to change what we know of as the internet today. But before we dive into all that goodness, let’s take a step back to run through what traditional domains are and define NFTs — that way, you can truly understand the superpowers behind web3 domains.

Typically, you interact with a traditional domain when you type the address (like Twitter.com) into your browser. But did you know traditional domains were originally built to do so much more on the internet? Think of functionalities like email and payments. Hard to believe, right?

But as we can see, traditional domains haven’t progressed much beyond displaying websites. This might be because traditional domains have been controlled by centralized servers since the internet was created. This made it much more difficult for developers to innovate on top of that technology.

Luckily for us, the tech that powers web3 domains (a.k.a. blockchains) opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for us on the web!

***Okay, so how does blockchain technology make these web3 domains so special?***

Great question! web3 domains are essentially a suite of smart contracts, which is a fancy term to describe software written on a public blockchain. This means that instead of one company controlling your data online, the power is transferred back to you as the user. And by being built on blockchains, anyone can look at the data stored there, creating a level of ultimate openness and transparency. 

On top of that, there is the benefit of enhanced security — only you hold the power to make updates to your web3 domain, which minimizes worries about servers getting hacked or domains getting stolen.

All that to say, blockchain superpowers give everyone a safer way to surf the internet while also giving control back to you over what gets shared and where it gets shared.

***Cool, I’m starting to get the power of blockchain but am still not 100% sure what I can DO with a web3 domain?***

We were just about to get to that! To quickly summarize, here are your domain’s superpowers (with more exciting new features on the way):

1. Simplify crypto transactions by replacing all your complicated wallet addresses with your domain name as your username.
2. Use your domain to receive 275+ coins and tokens across multiple blockchain networks. 
3. Login to apps with your domain name as your universal web3 username.
4. Unlike traditional domains, fully own and control your domain. You buy it once, you own it for life!
5. Easily create and host websites, ranging from personal websites to NFT galleries. ",0.9959

So technically.. I have 0.75 BTC..

I'm Chris, Co-Founder and Chief Risk Officer of DeFinity Markets. You can check out our leadership team here:[ https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership](https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership)

We’ve spent most of our careers in foreign exchange, working at major banks like Barclays and Lloyds, helping institutions move hundreds of billions through some of the most tightly regulated markets in the world.

And we’ve learned exactly what institutions need:

**Security. Compliance. Separation of risk.**

When crypto started to mature, we saw what was coming: \*\*Institutional capital was on the way.\*\* But it wasn’t going to flow through hype or tokens. And no, banks weren’t going to use MetaMask.

They were going to need infrastructure that looked like what they already trust:

**Regulated. Secure. Transparent.**

So we got to work.

We spent years doing the regulatory groundwork, the hard stuff most avoid and turned it into our moat. We built DeFinity as a **non-custodial platform from day one**.

Why? Because institutions don’t want their trading venue holding their assets.

**Anyone remember FTX?** They need separation of function, risk controls, and audit trails.

We integrated with Fireblocks (who are like MetaMask for institutions)  which provides secure wallet infrastructure for institutions and made onboarding possible in under four hours.

And yes, we have a **live token: $DEFX**  
It’s not an afterthought. It's a key part of the ecosystem, used for fee discounts and future functionality as the platform expands.

We’re not another token without utility. We’re not a DeFi experiment hoping for traction.We’re not waiting for regulators to catch up.

✅ We’re serving clients

✅ We’re generating revenue

✅ We’re regulated, integrated, and live

This isn’t a vision. It’s a functioning product. And we’re just getting started.

To stay up to date with out latest news follow us in X [https://x.com/definitynetwork](https://x.com/definitynetwork) or join our Telegram [https://t.me/DeFinity\_Community](https://t.me/DeFinity_Community)

**TLDR:**

**The problem:** Institutional capital wants into crypto but most projects fail on regulation, custody, or compliance.

**The solution:** DeFinity Markets provides regulated, non-custodial infrastructure with full Fireblocks integration.

**The proof:**

– Fully doxxed team with decades of FX & TradFi experience

– Years spent securing regulatory approvals

– Onboarding in under 4 hours – Real clients. Real volume. Real revenue

We’re not building for a hypothetical future. We’re already live.

> Privacy is the soul of crypto, and without it, nothing else we’re doing really matters.
> If you care about financial sovereignty, you need privacy. If you care about coordinating with others to effect social change, or thinking freely, or building a more prosperous society, you need the free exchange of value. Freedom begins with privacy.
>
> As engineers and scientists working on Zcash, we have spent years developing private financial tools that will be embedded into the future of civilization. It is no exaggeration to say that our descendants will either live in a world that rests upon the foundations that we are building today, or else live in a world that we neglected.
>
> Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to ship real, strong privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. Solving the privacy problem with cryptography was only the first step: we needed to quickly iterate and improve our cryptography so that it was practical to run on phones, and invest heavily into research that would make it possible to scale. Today, our innovations sit at the heart of many decentralized protocols.
>
> But while the path forward for scaling private on-chain payments is now straightforward, no project has addressed the fundamental challenge of scaling private wallets at the same time.
>
> Most users of cryptocurrencies will use wallet software that relies on a remote server to enable sending and receiving payments. This helps address scaling problems by pushing bandwidth and computational burdens away from users’ devices, but comes at the cost of requiring the user to relinquish their privacy to remote services.
>
> To make our privacy-preserving monetary project a reality we need a user experience that is just as convenient as one that has no privacy at all.
>
> The simplest solution is to use exotic cryptography to enable remote servers to assist our local wallet software without revealing any private information. We’ve known that this is theoretically possible, but until recently it seemed to be impractical at scale — at least a decade of new science away, or so we thought.
>
> Enter Project Tachyon. With existing cryptography and some clever protocol adjustments, it is completely practical for Zcash’s wallet software to synchronize with a highly active blockchain full of transactions by outsourcing the expensive parts to untrusted third-party servers. The servers don’t learn anything about your wallet and cannot even tell which on-chain transactions correspond with their users.
>
> To be sure, the cryptography needed to make this possible and scalable is still not simple. Fortunately, Zcash has a long track record of building and shipping this exact kind of advanced cryptography. We’ve already set the stage for it in some of our recent upgrades, and with Project Tachyon we plan to make rapid progress deploying the remaining changes over the next year.
>
> I’m excited that we have such strong enthusiasm and alignment in the Zcash community to make it a reality. But I’m also relieved that we can meet the moment and actually build highly scalable, unstoppable digital money. We don’t have time to wait for any more research or scientific advances.

2025-07-16 12:56:03,"Solana and BNB Just Posted One of Blockchain’s Busiest Weeks Ever and Here’s What I Noticed This past week, I saw something interesting across the chains. Total blockchain activity hit a new record. Over 342 million transactions happened in just seven days. That’s the highest weekly number I’ve come across so far.  
  
Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron led the activity. Solana especially stood out. It alone handled almost 60 percent of all transactions. That spike didn’t just happen out of nowhere. A lot of it came from meme coins launching non-stop on Solana platforms like LetsBonk and Pumpfun. These tokens are highly speculative but they’re pulling in a ton of new users. The chain has been nonstop busy.  
  
BNB Chain had a smaller slice of the volume, around 19 percent, but it still has the most applications built on it. It covers everything from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and that mix helps keep users active and money flowing. It also got a recent speed boost after the Maxwell upgrade, which reduced block time to around 0.75 seconds. It’s smoother now and feels more responsive.  
  
Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron are also still among the most used chains daily. Tron even passed Ethereum in daily USDT volume. It’s mostly large whale trades plus over a million smaller retail transactions happening every day. That kind of consistent flow shows that these chains actually have real communities using them.  
  
Sure, some of this spike is probably driven by speculation and hype but even with that, 342 million transactions in one week is a serious number. It shows more people are actively using blockchains rather than just watching from the sidelines.

The weather was fine, and the daily APY was thicc! the scams and rug pulls were there, but a lot more thought had gone into these projects. Ahhh OHM, TIME, STRONG.. take me back! Around 17,000 Alt coins existed back in those days (meaningful) with many of them dead. Liquidity was juicy after the COVID crash and the choice of alts to invest in MUCH smaller. Alts would pump 10x in a few hours. Launchpads were the real alpha and APY plays made you feel like you were really about to retire in a few weeks! Alas for many, it was simply moving liquidity to the early adopters.

Fast forward. It’s July 2025, we’ve had sunshine for a week in the UK and BTC.D is looking like it’s about to make moves. Many Altcoin moonbois from 2021 are now BTC maxis having joined the halls of BTC Valhalla with the once 2017 Altcoin moonbois! 
What’s left, a somewhat hopeful, slightly delusional and most certainly deep in the red group of crypto bros praying a 2025 AC Szn will set them free. 

At the end of 2021 around 400k tokens had been born, lived and died. By the end of 2025 it’s estimated there will have been nearly 100 million tokens created. As of today it’s believed there are hundreds of thousands of active / alive projects

Think about that number, think about how much liquidity is needed to nourish hundreds of thousands of projects this Altcoin season, draining liquidity - spread thin like butter. There simply isnt enough liquidity in the market to feed the hunger of all.

Sadly, MANY legitimate, great projects will see no more than maybe a 1-3x top 100s may see 50% to 1x.

This fabled Alt season will be like spreading butter over the world’s largest piece of toast.

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the crypto scene and currently looking into different exchanges to get started. Naturally, big names like KuCoin come up a lot, but I also stumbled upon JuCoin seems like a newer, smaller platform.

This got me thinking: does it actually make a difference if you go with a large, established exchange versus a smaller, newer one? Obviously, the bigger platforms have more coins and trading pairs, but sometimes newer platforms seem to offer perks like lower fees or more responsive support.

Curious to hear from folks who’ve tried both kinds of platforms what’s been your experience? Are there hidden trade-offs with going smaller? Or does the brand size not really matter if the features line up with what you need?

Not looking for shilling just genuine takes from actual users would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!

But, if we’re honest, they haven’t yet translated into broad, mainstream adoption. The dream of billions of people using blockchain every day is still largely that—a dream. To make it reality, we need to rethink how we build and deliver blockchain-powered experiences.

One of the biggest hurdles is usability. The current dominant interface to blockchain —non-custodial wallets—remains too complex for the average person. Managing private keys, writing down 24-word seed phrases, buying native tokens just to perform transactions, navigating multiple chains, bridging assets, KYC’ing repeatedly for each app, and figuring out how to convert crypto to fiat and back. This is not a user experience built for the mainstream....

I understand the argument for bitcoin appreciation - it's won the battle for digital store of value based on it's unique origin story, fixed supply and a culture that will always enforce that limit.  But store of value seems like pretty much a winner take all category.  Much like there was really only gold as the global store of value asset for 2000 years, it's reasonable to think that there might only be bitcoin far off into the future.



So, that's bitcoin, but what about the rest of it?   What is the expectation that any other token will appreciate over the long term?  Some of them might have interesting technology or perform some use case particularly well, but how does this utility lead to long term appreciation?  As the price goes up, it will just be undercut by new entrants offering the same service at a lesser price.  Utility tokens (for lack of a better word), just feel like commodities to me.  They may go up or down over the short term as they compete against each other, but in the long run they are all going to zero (or close to it).  The only argument I see for buying any of this stuff, is just to cynically get in, hoping to exploit the greater fools and get out in time.

I just wanted to come back here and give a proper update, especially after all the support and warnings I received.

I ended up telling my friend what was going on, and she was understandably very shocked. She really believed she was getting to know someone with genuine intentions, and to find out it was all a lie designed to scam her — it hit her hard. She’s upset, of course, but also incredibly thankful that she didn’t invest any money or go further. She kept saying she felt so lucky that we found out in time.

We confronted him and — surprise, surprise — he denied everything. By then, she was too hurt to keep talking, so I stepped in and told him straight: we know it’s a scam, we’ve reported both him and the site, and we’re done. (I might’ve said a little more than that… but you get the idea 😅)

But more than anything, I just wanted to say **thank you** — sincerely, deeply — to all of you who commented on my original post. Whether your replies were cautious, blunt, snarky, or kind — every single one helped open our eyes to the truth. And you helped protect someone from not just being scammed, but emotionally devastated.

I know it’s easy to scroll past things online, but you didn’t. You took the time to reply, to warn us, and to care. That means more than I can express. You may not realize it, but you truly made a difference in someone’s life.

Wishing every single one of you good vibes, smooth days, and lots of wins — in trading, in life, and everything in between. Hope the world treats you kindly. You’re all absolute legends, and I’m so grateful for this community.

Thank you. 💛",0.9948

This has ZERO MEANING in crypto, where it's impossible and pointless to buy every last microdecimal point of a currency. There is NO CURRENCY that is meaningfully measured by its market cap. No one says, ""Oh, the market cap of the Japanese yen is $X trillion,"" because that's not how currencies are measured. 

GDP is measured, yes. But GDP is a measurement of an economy's economic activity, not a way to measure currencies. If crypto analysts were honest, they'd try to measure crypto value using GDP, but crypto analysts also know that the actual GDP of crypto -- including Bitcoin -- is probably hilariously low compared to its ""market cap"" because trading activity generally isn't included in GDP. Which is probably why you don't see references to ""the GDP of Bitcoin"" or whatnot very often, if ever.

And people in crypto intuitively know this. You KNOW that if anyone tries to sell even 0.1% of Bitcoin, the ""market cap"" of Bitcoin will be plummet. Anyone who quotes ""market cap"" to you as a reason to feel confident in crypto is either uninformed or actively trying to deceive you.

""Market cap"" for crypto is just another way to reiterate the price, but using bigger numbers, which is especially useful for small coins. It means absolutely nothing, and it is stupid that the crypto community harps it so much.",0.7161

One area worth considering is memecoins on the XRPL. The XRP Ledger has become a surprisingly vibrant environment for emerging tokens, offering fast and inexpensive transactions compared to many other networks.

For those who enjoy trading in a more automated way, there is even a new tool similar to the Bonk Bot on Telegram. It’s called the PHNIX Bot, and it provides the same convenient trading experience but specifically for XRPL tokens.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fifth monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JULY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **JUNE Highlights:** All flat or red, except **TRON.**  **BTC** in overall lead, **Tron** in second, **XRP** in third:  also the only three cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD. The Class of 2025 is now tied for the worst performing portfolio with the 2022 Top Ten.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 8 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+256% vs S&P500's +70% - see below for details).

# Month Six – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/jf3gp1jac1df1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d5bc6de106a986bf8a9dea335d5b4894e54ffa

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

June highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Flat or in the red 
* **Tron** outperforms the field in June
* Halfway through 2025, only three cryptos are in positive territory: **BTC, Tron,** and **XRP**  (just barely)

# June Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/5rf4nvhbc1df1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc848d4c016db61171a8fcebf69cd91983093ee4

Six months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# June Winners and Losers

***June Winners*** – **Tron** was the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, up +3%.

***June Losers*** – **ADA** (-20%), **DOGE** (-17%), and **AVAX** (-17%) lost the most ground this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains slight lead over Tron, portfolio under water, AVAX and DOGE in last place

Year to date **BTC** (+13%) maintains a slight lead over second place **Tron** (+9%).  The rest are either flat or in the red with **AVAX** and **DOGE** taking up the rear at -52% and -50% respectively.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** six months ago is worth $113 today.

YTD the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.  The last time the 2025 Top Ten portfolio was in positive territory was the end of [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)). 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio shed $43 in June, about the same it gained in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$824**, roughly the same value as February and April.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, six months later:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +46% (total value $1,457)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +668% (total value $7,683)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +867% (total value $9,674) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +301% (total value $4,015)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +153% (total value $2,533)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +44% (total value $1,444)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$28,453.**

https://preview.redd.it/3hokvf5hc1df1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3e611002f9049635ea66fdfbe8a44428f0d946

**That’s up +256%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/wjpim6cic1df1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=d36aecfe9946dcb52f99c9a43cf8c3ca2066a2db

In summary: ***That’s a +256% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/fa00ytcjc1df1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6630f5b664991235098b32c20312517b6fc9804

The S&P 500 is up +5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,054 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,319 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,473 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,919 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,650 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,300 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,614 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,299 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,054 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,629.**

That is up **+70%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+256%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

2025-07-15 00:07:02,"The hardest decision I've ever made. To sell 🤯    Started trading in 2019. Lost a total of around $5,500 over the course of a year trading or ""trying to trade"" futures. That was an insane amount of money for me. We lived in a $600 apt and drove ""2nd hand subarus"". I learned the hard way to leave futures the fuckkk alone. 

 I've made ALL that loss back and then some with some basic realizations. 

1. Never ever ever ever buy something that's going ""parabolic"" or up over 100% or more  in the last 24 hrs. Fuck ""fomo"" I don't allow myself to touch it. It'll correct HARD as soon as I buy in. Always does. I guess i have the ""touch""

2. I buy the ""blood"" or the ""fear"" graphs that look like the lowest end of a half pipe. When the price has bottomed out for months or weeks not going any lower, almost bouncing off an invisible wall. I buy, buy, buy. ☺️

3. Make sure the project still has a ""pulse"". Website still active, Twitter, etc. No ominous rumors or ""de-listing"" in the immediate future. 

4. Total supply vs circulating supply. I like to see the total supply under 1 billion and the total & circulating exactly the same. This means its probably not a ""rug pull"" and some developer is going to dump a massive supply making the price plummet like a meteor. If it has a low supply, the price action can be insane with $100 turning into $1000 overnight at times. Sometimes more. More volatility, more risk, better if you aren't investing a lot.

5. Once my initial investment doubles, I pull out half. This is very hard to do in the moment. But if you can find the self discipline, you'll risk nothing but profit. 

6. Unless I'm really really bullish about a certain project, I leave money (not too much) on the exchange with emergency stop losses in place. I use multiple exchanges. My initial investment money eventually pulled back into a secure wallet after my initial investment doubles.

7. Personally I understand that I don't have the major liquidity required to invest and (actually make good money) in the safer options like BTC or ETH. Therefore I seek out low cap, low supply, projects that have previously done at least a 20×.

I use a ""blanket strategy"" putting smaller amounts into multiple smaller projects. If one or two outshine the rest I'll buy more of those. Pretty simple.

8. Most importantly, I set my stop losses and LEAVE it alone. I don't allow myself to check my portfolio very often. I go on with my hectic busy daily shit-show and let things grow in the background. This works best for me. My emotions can't be effected as easily if I don't allow myself to repeatedly check my balance throughout the day.

9. Buy the fear, sell the greed. Don't buy the greed and sell the fear. 
""When there's blood on the streets, buy, buy, buy."" -Warren Buffet (I think I got the quote right...)

This basic strategy is the only one I found,  that finally works for me. Hopefully it'll help anyone new to this space. May the fuckary be in your favor. ",-0.8848

2025-07-14 23:22:17,"A shockingly clever new mini-advance-fee scam to steal crypto that doesn't even require interacting with the victim has appeared This is Atomic Shrimp's video talking about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TijuiMegg5o

I have seen a couple comments on YouTube that were attempting this scam, but especially knowing how greedy people are it really does seem like a good portion of crypto people would definitely fall for this because it preys on type of people who, if they saw a wallet stuffed with cash on the ground, would take all the money in it without a second thought.

In short, the scam is really quite clever and quite simple: the scammer loads a large amount of a valuable ERC-20 token (e.g. USDT or USDC) in some token onto a crypto wallet and then publicly shares the seed phrase in some naive-looking comment like this:

> Hey, I'm having trouble moving some of my crypto from my SafePal hardware wallet to Binance, can someone else help me? My seed phrase is [...]

An unscrupulous victim loads that seed phrase into their wallet and notices a large amount of some token, like 10,000 USDT in the wallet. However, the wallet is devoid of ETH/TRX/POLY/SOL/whatever other coin is needed to pay the network fee to withdraw the token. So the victim, intending to steal the tokens for themselves, send the required amount for the network fee into the wallet. However, to their dismay, the wallet is a 2-of-2 multisig and they can't actually send the tokens. The scammer, of course, controls both signers and uses this to withdraw the network fee that was sent by the victim.

While this scam could theoretically work on any network, Atomic Shrimp showed it happening on TRON, which actually makes the most sense when you think about it a bit more: on Polygon and Solana, the network fees are so low that the victims would only need to send a minimal amount to have enough to send the tokens away, so the scammers would only be able to steal some 0.01 POLY from each victim. On ETH, the opposite problem is presented: network fees are so *high* that stealing the victim's network fee payment would consume most of it in real network fees to transfer the booty out. But TRON's weird resource system makes it uniquely profitable.

For those unaware, TRON has two resources: energy and bandwidth. All transactions consume bandwidth and it is the physical transaction size in bytes. Each TRON address is allocated 600 units of bandwidth for free which regenerates over a 24-hour period. Energy, meanwhile, represents computational power which is consumed by smart contracts (equivalent concept to gas on ETH-like chains). Energy is not free and must be paid for by burning TRX or by staking it. Transferring TRX is not considered a smart contract call and thus it only requires bandwidth, which is free. Calling a smart contract (like the `transfer` function of a TRC-20 token) will consume bandwidth **and** energy, and it is quite expensive since TRON punishes frequently-used contracts by making their callers pay extra penalty energy units. At the time of writing, a transfer of USDT burns 13.5 TRX (at a cost of ~0.30 USD per TRX).

Thus, the victim would have to transfer in around 20 TRX with which to pay the energy cost to be safe, which is around 6 USD. This can then be yoinked by the scammers at no cost since transferring TRX costs only bandwidth which is free.",0.6645

2025-07-14 18:15:38,"What to expect for Crypto Week July 14-18, 2025 The United States House of Representatives have OFFICIALLY set this week as “Crypto Week”. More specifically, Monday July 14 2025 – Friday July 18 2025. This is an epic historical moment for Cryptocurrency as a whole that may define and redefine regulatory changes, specifically for the United States. This could have global effects and implications as other nations may learn from this experience and decisions made this week. I wish they called it “Cryptocurrency Week” to make it more official instead of a shortened “Crypto Week” which makes it feel like it’s a fad or not as important in my opinion. Nonetheless, I don’t think any of us can complain that they are scheduling an ENTIRE week for cryptocurrency discussions, which is a historical moment for the United States cryptocurrency space.

# What is “Crypto Week”?

The United States House of Representatives has scheduled this week as “Crypto Week” to discuss and focus on all things cryptocurrency and related regulations and bills. They want to be the leaders for digital assets innovations and regulations while considering protection of the consumers and financial freedoms, or so they say. The week will include three major debates for “industry friendly” bills: Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, GENIUS Act, and CLARITY Act. We will get into more details on the Acts soon below. The hype and forecasted positive impact of Crypto Week in the cryptocurrency space has led a Bitcoin rally to new All Time Highs as well as a significant surge in cryptocurrency related stocks such as Coinbase, Micro Strategy, Block, Robinhood (unfortunately… I still have a long lasting bitter taste in my mouth anytime Robinhood is mentioned haha) and more.

Let us get into the nitty gritty of the major legislations that will be under debate this week:

# Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act)

·       H.R. 3633 - CLARITY Act

·       During last month, June 2025, the act passed the committees vote and is slated for a full House vote this week.

·       CLARITY Act hopes to define what a digital commodity is. Excludes stablecoins, derivatives, and securities!

·       Act will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority of digital commodities while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have authority over investment contracts and securities related to cryptocurrency.

·       Bill includes a mature blockchain exemption, which lets decentralized blockchains to raise capital (limited to a cap of 75 Million USD in a 12 month period) exclusive of Securities and Exchange Commission registration. This change allows for reduced burdens of fundraising for projects that are compliant.

·       Bill will require cryptocurrency dealers, brokers, and exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while remaining compliant of their “strict” guidelines on transparency and protecting consumer assets.

·       Bill includes federal preemption for requiring KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) compliance as part of the already prevailing Bank Secrecy Act provisions. In short, this federal rule will supersede any State rules! I don’t agree with KYC… but we will have other non-KYC options hopefully!

# GENIUS Act

·       During last month, June 2025, the act was passed by the United States Senate.

·       GENIUS Act’s primary target is for stablecoins which are  cryptocurrencies that are designed to always have the same or consistent value… stable in a sense. They must be pegged to another asset, such as the United States dollar as an example.

·       Bill will require stablecoin creators/issuers have their assets backed by a reserve and to maintain the reserve requirement. This will protect consumers from liquidity failures… think Terra’s $LUNA fiasco… I hope this will ensure USDT and the rest of the stablecoins will need to PROVE their reserves!

·       If there is a bankruptcy for a stablecoin, the Bill will give repayment rights priority to coin holders first, which hopefully means retail consumers such as you and me (disregard if you are from an institution reading this HAHA)

·       Bill prohibits Congress and stablecoin senior execs from issuing stablecoins while they hold their public positions!

·       Bill enforces anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism sanctions on stablecoin issuers.

# Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21)

·       FIT21 passed the House vote way back in 2024 from BOTH major parties (Democrats and Republicans).

·       Bill is focused on bringing more clarity to regulations of digital assets which may include labeling tokens as commodities or securities (which I don’t agree with, cryptocurrency should be neither right?).

·       Bill will classify the digitalized assets coming from decentralized blockchains as a commodity under CFTC regulations while less decentralized digitalized assets will stay under SEC regulations (again, I don’t agree with this classification and I’m extremely curious what requirements they will decide on that determines a decentralized token versus a “less” decentralized token).

·       Bill will require decentralized blockchains to undergo a certification process.

·       Bill will require both the CFTC and the SEC to create more rules for anti-fraud in regards to cryptocurrency and digital assets specifically.

I am extremely excited that lawmakers and House leaders have designated an entire week for cryptocurrency discussions, promoting growth and innovation friendly agendas as a digital assets leader globally! This is a huge step forward towards mass adoptions of cryptocurrency and no nation can ignore cryptocurrencies any longer.

My hope is that these bills will offer clear, or at least clearer, legal certainty and promote innovations. As we see nations discussing stablecoins, we definitely need clearer rules for consumer confidence and to thwart future failures of current and new stablecoins. For example, I don’t know how Tether USDT has not proved that it’s backed by reserves (cash, equivalents, and Treasury Bills) and just hopes that we will take their “word” for it… Overall, I hope CBDCs are blocked for greater privacy for digital currencies.

2025-07-14 15:37:07,"CLARITY Act this week! Hey all, this is super important for everyone in crypto, not just ETH holders (but ETH ETF’s have a huge impact in terms of legal friction to finally supporting ETH ETF staking).

The CLARITY Act (H.R. 3633) is up right now, and it could seriously change the game for the entire space.

Why does this matter?

	•	Ends the constant “is it a security or a commodity?” fight.

	•	Defines truly decentralized and mature crypto projects as digital commodities, not securities.

	•	Protects staking, mining, validating — all core activities — so that whenever a crypto stakes it remains a digital commodity.

	•	Opens the door for more crypto ETFs, staking products, and DeFi innovation without SEC clampdowns.

Here’s an actual excerpt straight from the bill:

Including, as incentive-based rewards—
(i) to users of the digital commodity or any blockchain system to which the digital commodity relates;
(ii) for activities directly related to the operation of the blockchain system, such as mining, validating, staking, or other activity directly tied to the operation of the blockchain system; or
(iii) to the existing holders of another digital commodity, in proportion to the total units of such other digital commodity as are held by each person.
— CLARITY Act of 2025, H.R. 3633, Section defining “End User Distribution”

This is about more than just ETH — it’s about protecting the future of decentralized networks, DeFi, and anyone who actually wants to participate in securing or building the space.

If you care about crypto staying open and decentralized, call your rep. Even one call makes noise.

2025-07-14 14:55:15,"SUI quietly delivers a +125% run — without the hype While BTC, PENGU and others dominate the news cycle, SUI has been building in the background - and it's starting to show.

* Price: $3.87 (+10.8% in 24h)
* Volume: $2.65B (+180%)
* All-time growth: +125.93%
* Circulating Supply: 3.45B out of 10B
* Market Cap: $13.4B

Sui doesn’t rely on hype cycles - it’s a tech-focused L1 chain with its own Move-based architecture, optimized for scalability and parallel execution.

Many traders are spotting consistent liquidity on exchanges like Binance, WhiteBIT, and OKX. That’s a sign of real activity, not just speculation.

We often chase ATH. But sometimes, the best plays are the ones building quietly, with fundamentals that are only now catching up in price.

2025-07-14 13:14:04,"sniperoo been showing up in convos lately... what’s the hype? real users weigh in? so i keep seeing sniperoo pop up randomly in threads... not as a main topic, but kinda dropped into conversations here and there. saw a few mentions on crypto twitter too. at first i thought it was just another trading bot or something, but from what i’ve gathered it’s more like a tool that lets you trade directly from places like twitter or discord? also apparently works through axiom and bullx without needing to bounce between tabs or open phantom.



i’m not the type to just jump into every shiny new tool, but if it really helps shave off seconds during early launches, that’s something i’d seriously consider. been wrecked enough times trying to snipe small caps where by the time i switch tabs, click swap, approve, etc, the price has already doubled or i miss the entry completely.



i’m not trying to promote it or anything... just wondering if anyone here has actually used sniperoo and can speak from experience. is the execution really that much faster compared to phantom or other tools? also curious how it compares to some of the more popular telegram bots or degen extensions.



would love to hear honest thoughts, especially from people using it regularly. like, does it actually help you get in earlier or is it just another layer added to the same process?",0.9841

2025-07-14 12:44:02,"[SERIOUS] Can we build a crowd-sourced blockchain and use it to open-source AI research? Specifically, research into automation of critical services like medicine (folding@home, genome, etc), construction (automate home construction) and agricultural robotics? 

The big players are all focused on AI services that can make them nice profit, but that ultimately aren't very productive for society as a whole. I am thinking whether millions of computers worldwide, in exchange for tokens on a blockchain, could mine an AI training database for high-impact social problems? Climate-change maybe even. 

The key goal I''m thinking of is agricultural automation. Producing a blueprint that would allow anyone, anywhere, to set up a simple automated farming system could really revolutionise the world in extreme ways. Of course no business wants to invest money in a platform that would eventually put themselves out of business. So open-source crowd-contributed seems the more feasible approach. 

Would millions of computers come close to the power of a farm of H200s? ",-0.2982

Registered, put a few thousand dollars (I can recover, I'm mostly worried about identity theft now).

Immediately got flagged and requested further KYC, at that point I believed them because they mentioned multiple IPs and I was indeed juggling a VPN to watch netflix. Unfortunately, now they have my ID, too.

I know I'm not getting my money back, but please, just keep in mind that coingecko don't bother removing exchanges that are known for having scammed others even a year back. If you can pressure them into doing something about it I'd be grateful, I just did my part. Also if anyone knows the full extend of what they could do with my stolen identity, let me know. I'd also love feedback from others who have gotten scammed by kcex.

2025-07-14 12:10:50,"Multi-Timeframe Crypto Scanner with 50+ Technical Indicators [Creator Seeking Feedback] Hey r/CryptoCurrency! I've been working on [AssetRadars.com](http://AssetRadars.com), a crypto scanner focused specifically on Coinbase pairs with comprehensive technical analysis:

Key Features:

	• Price change filtering (1H, 1D, 7D, 30D, 1Y)

	• RSI overbought/oversold detection

	• MACD trend analysis

	• Moving averages (SMA/EMA crossovers)

	• 50+ indicators including Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku, ATR volatility

	• Real-time Coinbase Pro data for all USD pairs

Currently focused on Coinbase-only to ensure data quality and reliability. The goal is to help traders find assets meeting specific technical criteria without manually checking hundreds of charts on the exchange.

Looking for feedback from the community:

	• What indicators do you find most valuable for crypto analysis?

	• Are there specific filtering combinations you'd want to see?

	• How important is real-time vs. slightly delayed data for your workflow?

	• Worth expanding to other exchanges, or is Coinbase focus valuable?

Would love to hear thoughts on whether tools like this are becoming essential for navigating the current market, and what features would make this most useful for your trading/analysis process.

I swapped something for \~1 TAO (worth about $400 at the time), which then never appeared in my account. This is the complete log of my conversation with their support team since then. Only my personal information and their AI bot's messages have been removed.

I'm not sure what else I can do at this point, other than warn people to steer clear. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to get my money back, I'd love to hear it.

**May 8**

**Me:** I need more help. I need to inquire about the status of a Pro Exchange I made to TAO which I haven't been able to access for days.

**Me:** Exchange Pro ID: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`

**Me:** The TAO seems to be inaccessible to me. I talked to support and they said they were working on it, but that was four days ago. If it's not getting fixed shortly, can I just get it reverted/refunded to something else?

**Anthony:** Thank you for providing the details. I am reviewing the issue - please give me a moment.

**Anthony:** Our team is still working on this case. At the moment, we don’t have any updates we can share with you.

**Me:** Can you simply refund it or send it on to an external address?

**Anthony:** In that case, we’re already working on processing the refund of your balance. Unfortunately, implementing the fix is taking some time.

**Me:** Okay... hours, days, weeks? I need to have some idea what to expect.

**Anthony:** I’ve requested an ETA from the team and will get back to you as soon as I receive it.

**Me:** Okay, thank you.

----

**May 12**

**Me:** I'd like an update on the status of my TAO exchange, or a refund. It's been a week now. (TX id: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`)

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tim:** Unfortunately, we have not finished fixing the issue as of yet, we deeply apologize for the prolonged wait and the inconvenience caused. We completely understand that a week for this case is unacceptable. Your funds are completely safe. We will keep you updated.

**Me:** You can't even tell me if it'll be today or a month from now? I need something, here.

**Tim:** We have not received a fixed ETA for the fix yet. I am currently checking with our team for more specific information. Our team has let us know that they will provide us with the update either today or tomorrow. The issue will most likely be fixed in the following week. Again, we deeply apologize for the wait. We will contact you via this chat or e-mail once there is an update.

**Me:** Okay, good to hear, thank you.

**Tim:** Thank you for reaching out as well. We will do our best to fix the issue.

----

**May 19**

**Me:** This is me checking in a week later. I haven't heard anything and still don't see my TAO from exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`.

**Alejandro:** Hi! Checking! No updates as of yet, sir/madam. Thank you lots for addressing us, we kindly ask you to wait a bit.

**Me:** I've been waiting for two weeks now. A week ago, they said they would have the update that day or the next, and it would most likely be fixed by now. I'm trying to be reasonable and patient, but at some point I'm going to have to start complaining loudly about this and hope it gets you guys to fix this. There's no way it should be taking this long for a simple fix or refund. Could someone explain to me the exact nature of the problem? Either the money is lost, in which case I should get a refund, or it's not, in which case it shouldn't be a challenge for one of your tech guys to forward the coins out of the address.

**Alejandro:** Checking with the team once again, one moment, please.

**Me:** Thank you.

**Alejandro:** The nature of the issue is that TAO is not supported at the moment but we'll find the resolution. Waiting for an update, one moment, please, we'll notify you.

**Me:** With Exchange Pro, you guys have custody of the money during the transfer. That means you have the TAO. Can't you simply send me its equivalent in ETH or BTC or whatever, and then you're welcome to take as long as you want working out the TAO problem?

**Alejandro:** ETA is the next week, sir/madam. It'll be done! Rest assured.

**Me:** Yes, you said that last week. What is the problem with what I suggested? You have the TAO. You're having problems with it. Just send me its value in some other coin, and keep it for yourself.

**Alejandro:** There are technical nuances that would be a problem. Our team will resolve this situation and you'll be notified as soon as it's done.

**Me:** Okay, but if it's still not done a week from now, I am going to start complaining loudly on forums and all that crap. Hopefully it won't come to that. Thanks, have a good day.

**Alejandro:** We assure you that the issue will be resolved, sir. It just needs a bit of waiting. Thank you so much for your patience, we sincerely appreciate it. Have a good one and keep in touch please.

----

**May 27**

**Me:** It's been yet another week. I hope this is resolved?

**Kate:** Hello! Could you please give a brief description of the issue?

**Me:** I've been waiting three weeks on my TAO from pro tx: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. (See earlier conversation.)

**Kate:** That's odd. According to our records, the conversion with the ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has finished, the TAO should be in your account.

**Me:** Am I talking to an actual person? See the previous discussion with three other agents regarding this transaction. The TAO disappeared.

**Kate:** My apologies, let me check again. Our development team provided a new ETA - they said the issue is being worked on and should be resolved within this week. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience.

**Me:** You've been saying that every time since the first day. Again, since they are the ones that have the TAO, can they simply keep that and manually refund me the equivalent so that I can get this taken care of?

**Kate:** I will try to forward that request to our team, but since it's outside standard procedure, it will be most likely denied.

**Me:** Please do forward that request. Can you at the very least give me a firm ETA? You said it will be finished this week, so I will be able to get my money out by Friday? How about if not, they do a manual refund? I feel I have been reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.

**Kate:** I'm sorry, but I'm working with the information that is being provided to me by our development team. They gave me an ETA of ""Within this week"". That's all I can say, unfortunately.

**Me:** Please pass along my request that they either ACTUALLY get it done this time, or go ahead and manually refund me. Thank you.

----

**June 14**

**Me:** It's a month and a half now and I've heard nothing and I *still* see no TAO from my pro tx `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. This is totally unacceptable. What's the deal?

**Benjamin:** Hello, let me check. My apologise for delay. Still checking information. We apologise. I forwarded it over to the technical team, they are dealing with this issue. Please contact us with in next 2 days if your problem is not solved.

**Me:** It's been a month and a half. Every time I check in, I've been told it'll be fixed or I'll have an update within a day or two. What happens in 2 days when it's still not fixed, because I promise you it won't be. Just send me a simple goddamned refund or manually send it out, already, this is nuts.

**Benjamin:** We are very sorry that this is causing so much inconvenience. I've told the team to take care of your issue first.

**Me:** They've had a month and a half to take care of the issue. You have ownership of the coins, so just send me the equivalent, and then you can take as long as you want to fix your buggy code. Otherwise I'm out of ideas, and I'll post this on Reddit and hope somebody out there can help, or at least give you some bad press.

**Benjamin:** Your issue is being processed. We apologise for the long wait. Please contact us in 2 days if the problem is not resolved.

**Me:** And if it isn't resolved?

**Benjamin:** We will do our best to resolve this issue.

**Me:** So if it isn't resolved, you'll ask me to wait another two days. Do you have a supervisor or someone I can talk to? This should not be so fucking hard, and I'm out of patience.

**Benjamin:** My apologise for delay. Our tech team process this issue. Could you please provide me with your email to contact with you? Our tech team will be able to solve the problem by 07:00 a.m. (UTC). At which time we will write to you by mail as you will need a conversion from your side, which we will request manually and you will receive your funds.

**Me:** `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`

**Benjamin:** Thank you, we will write you.

**Me:** I'll be expecting it.

**Benjamin:** Thank you for understanding.

----

**June 18**

**Me:** It's been another few days, and I never got an email. Let me know if the problem's fixed now, or if we can go ahead with the refund.

**Anthony:** I’ve requested an update from the technical team regarding the resolution of your case and will get back to you as soon as I receive it. The team is currently exploring ways to convert your TAO token into another asset, which would allow you to withdraw your funds — even if in a different form. We’re actively working on this solution, and I’ll let you know as soon as there’s any progress.

**Me:** Good to hear, anything I can exchange would be just fine by me. So later today, or what?

**Anthony:** I expect to receive an update within 1–2 hours and will reach out to you to coordinate the next steps or inform you of any further developments.

**Me:** Excellent.

*(2 hours later)*

**Anthony:** I'm sorry to inform you, but unfortunately, it will not be possible to resolve this task within the next 24 hours, as much as we would like to. At the moment, the team has attempted to perform the required conversion, but the system is refusing to process it. To fix the issue, we will either need to integrate a patch or explore an alternative workaround. I have escalated the issue as far as currently possible, and the team will work even harder on this than before. I sincerely apologize, and we are aiming to resolve this matter by next Monday, June 23, or to propose another viable solution by then.

**Me:** Can you just agree that someone will just manually send me the equivalent coinage by then, if you haven't fixed the problem?

**Tony:** We will resolve the issue in any case - it’s only a matter of time. For now, we’re sticking to the previously mentioned timeframes, and moving forward, everything will be handled in accordance with our standard policies, without exceptions.

**Anthony:** Сompensation is an option. We are also considering it as a possible solution to the issue, but we will proceed with it only if we are unable to implement another resolution.

----

**June 29**

**Me:** Well, it's been another two weeks. Is it fixed, or can I kindly get my compensation now?

**Tony:** Hello! Could you please clarify in more detail what your question is about, so I can assist you more accurately? I see the previous chats; I will review them now.

**Me:** See previous conversation. In short: pro transaction `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`, I never got my TAO from it, and it was two months ago.

**Tony:** I have requested the information and will get back to you once we receive a response.

*(Later, a different agent responds)*

**Benjamin:** Hello, our tech team still working of this issue. We will contact with you within next 12 hours. Thank you for understanding.

**Me:** Yeah, I'll be holding my breath.

**Benjamin:** Thank you.

----

**June 30**

**Me:** It's been 12 hours, and I've not been contacted.

**Anthony:** Unfortunately, no update has been received by our team member within the past 12 hours. I’ll check the status of your case now. Great news! The technical team responsible for the issue has confirmed that a fix has been implemented to prevent such situations from happening again. They are now continuing to work on resolving the active cases to return funds to affected users. We’re currently awaiting an update.

**Me:** And when should I expect to hear about that?

**Anthony:** I’ve requested information regarding this matter and will get back to you with an update shortly. I haven’t received a specific ETA yet, but work is actively ongoing, so I’m hopeful we’ll get one within the next few hours.

**Me:** Okay, thanks.

**July 1**

**Me:** Well, it's been a few hours.

**Alejandro:** We'll notify you as soon as we get an update, sir/madam. I assure you that the process is being done by our team.

----

**July 7**

**Me:** It's been another week.

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tessa:** Hi! Unfortunately there is no update at the moment. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused. Our team is still working on it.

----

**July 10**

**Me:** Get me a human. And is my refund ready?

**Alejandro:** Hi, sir/madam, unfortunately, no updates as of yet. Our team needs a bit more time to figure out the issue.

**Me:** And now?

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, it'll take some time for sure. Please wait for an update from us.

**Me:** I have been waiting for two and a half months. Please put me on with your supervisor.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I'm here to help and guide you. You will be notified about any updates.

*Full disclosure: At this point I decide to explain the situation to ChatGPT, and have it advise on how to move forward, since I was getting nowhere.*

**Me:**

>Pro Exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has been outstanding since 4 May—75 days without delivery.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, we understand your frustration and deeply apologise that it takes longer that you might have expected but such cases are complicated and require thorough viewing. We're kindly asking for your patience and understanding. Please, wait for an update from us.

**Me:** Acknowledgement noted, but a generic apology does not answer my request.

>**Action items (no later than 17:00 UTC 18 July):** 1. Confirm you have escalated this to a senior supervisor and provide their name, title, direct email, and your internal ticket/incident ID. 2. Give me a firm ETA in hours for one of the two outcomes already outlined:  • TAO sent to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  • USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH refund to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, every single piece of information is forwarded. We cannot proceed with a refund unless the investigation is done and we don't provide such information. Thank you so much for understanding. We're kindly asking you to wait for an update.

**Me:** Alejandro — Your refusal to give supervisory contact or even a rough ETA after 75 days is unacceptable and violates basic consumer‑protection standards. This is my final notice before formal escalation.

>• Today, I will file complaints with FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and the Saint Vincent & the Grenadines FSA, and I will publish this entire chat log on Reddit, X/Twitter, and Trustpilot. • You have 4 hours from the timestamp of this message to prevent that by providing ONE of the following with a verifiable TX‑ID:  1) Full TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  2) Refund in USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I promise you that our team is working on your request and we'll get to you with an update once we have one. Checking with the team, one moment.

**Me:** Alejandro—thanks for checking. I’ll wait 30 minutes for your concrete update. If I have neither a TX‑ID nor the supervisor’s contact by then, I’ll proceed with the formal complaints exactly as outlined.

**Alejandro:** Checked it, sir/madam. Our team is indeed working on resolving this situation but I'm afraid we cannot give ETA here.

**Me:** Alejandro — I’ve asked repeatedly for two very simple things — (1) a supervisor’s contact and (2) an ETA in hours. You’ve declined both. Per my prior notice, I am now proceeding with formal complaints to FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and other regulators, and will publish this chat log publicly. You can still stop that paperwork only by providing, within the next 2 hours:

>• a verifiable TX‑ID for either  a) the TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  b) a refund in USDT/USDC/WBTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam,it'll unfortunately take a bit more time for our team to complete your request. Please, kidnly asking you to wait a bit. We promise that it'll be done and you'll be notified about it.

2025-07-13 23:28:52,"Fone Network We stand at the edge of a new era. An era where connectivity isn’t just for the privileged few, but for everyone. An era where the power of blockchain, decentralization, and mobile technology comes together in one bold vision.

That vision is Fone Network. And that’s why I’m here to tell you—Fone Network is the future.

Let’s face it. The world is more connected than ever, but it’s also more divided. Billions of people still struggle with access to financial systems, reliable internet, or affordable services. Middlemen profit while users get left behind.

But what if we could change that? What if your phone wasn’t just a device to consume—but a gateway to earn, to share, to build real freedom?

That’s the promise of Fone Network.


Fone Network isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a complete ecosystem—accessible, user-friendly, and designed to work on mobile.

We’re not building for the elite. We’re building for everyone. Anyone with a smartphone can mine. Anyone can participate. Anyone can benefit.

Our technology is designed to scale, to be green and sustainable, and to empower real people—not just speculators.

And let’s talk about us. The Fone Network community.

This isn’t just a user base. It’s a movement. A global family bound by the belief that technology can—and should—serve everyone.

We’re developers. We’re miners. We’re investors. We’re believers.

We help each other. We educate. We innovate. We grow stronger every single day.


And this is just the beginning.

With every milestone, with every new partnership, we get closer to delivering on our mission.

Affordable transactions. A powerful blockchain. A thriving marketplace of apps and services. A currency you can actually use, not just speculate on.

We’re not just dreaming about the future. We’re building it.

Look at this community. Look at the potential. Look at the vision.

Fone Network is not just another project—it’s the future.

A future where opportunity is universal. Where you have the power in your pocket to change your life.

Join us. Build with us. Share our vision.

Because the future belongs to those brave enough to create it.

And that future is Fone Network.

2025-07-13 19:14:38,"Taking profits I invested a chunk of money in 90% BTC/10% alts over the last 2 years with a cost basis of around BTC $65k USD.  Was DCAing in 2022-2024.  My strategy was, based on historic patterns related to the halving cycle, to DCA in during crypto winter (I was a bit late to the party, really ramped up my buys in '24) and take it out about 500 days after the halving.

Well, we're 450 days post-halving starting tomorrow, and 500 lands around Labor Day.  

Today, I'm opening up my DCA window, setting a few larger limit orders in the 125-130k range, and I'm going to take profits gradually over the next 3 months.  The Bitcoin I sold this morning earned me about 85% profit, which feels great.  It's a bit goofy that the S&P 500 would've given me about the same return over the same time horizon, but fortunately I invested in that, too.  

It's possible we could see a rise into the 130s or even 140k range or higher, and that would give me even bigger profits.  However, this late in the cycle, it's also possible we could see a cyclical top any day now.

Taking profits is always a risk, and I'm sure I'll feel a little FOMO if the price goes even higher after I've sold half my stack.  However, the risk/reward ratio right now looks right, and I'm proud of myself for sticking to my plan.  I've been burned in the last cycle waiting for just the right time to buy ('20, '22) or sell ('21, ETH in '24), and learned my lesson.

Here's a reminder to you all, especially newcomers, to remember to take profits.  Have an exit strategy, and stick to it.  Don't get left holding the bag when the bull market ends.  Upswings have been short and sweet this cycle.  Enjoy the green days while they last!",0.9887

2025-07-13 18:50:19,"The ""Alt-Season"" narrative is likely a trap. You need to seriously consider what your goal is if you're not selling any ALTS through the recent rally. Bitcoin has been absolutely pumping over the last week and refusing to give back any gains as traders (and insiders) speculate on Crypto Week, and the ""BIG THINGS"" that are coming out of the US. With the money flooding into crypto ALTS have pumped with many making short term gains in the last week that far exceed what Bitcoin has been able to pull.

Now with Bitcoin eyeing a $120K weekly close you have to ask yourself what's going to happen during crypto week (starting tomorrow) and if anything ""BIG"" is actually going to happen.

The way I see it is one of three things are going to happen:

1. Something Big happens for Bitcoin (not alts) like the US announcing they are selling Bitcoin Bonds - and Bitcoin pumps and alts likely continue pumping alongside.
2. Nothing big happens resulting in a sell off, Bitcoin gives back most of the recent gains and alts gets destroyed in the proceeding dump.
3. Something big happens that insiders postured for and it's still a sell the news event. Alts and Bitcoin both see dumps with Alts getting destroyed due to the lack of positive news.

I think it should be pretty clear to everyone that whatever happens this coming week during crypto week nothing announced will be particularly bullish for Alts. So if you are holding recently purchased alts that are in profit. **You really need to ask yourself what exactly is your goal?** In 2 out of 3 likely scenarios alts price action get murdered over the next seven days, and Bitcoin will need absolutely huge news to continue the recent buy the rumor, pump - that would keep the consecutive alt pumping happening.

2025-07-13 14:43:39,"Altcoin Season or Bull-trap? I know that there are a bunch of crypto influencers and articles coming out about the recent price action in the market but I didn't really see much positive economic activity to really garner a boon to the upside. I know that J. Powell is supposedly going to resign and or be replaced but that doesn't mean much for tax rate cuts in the immediate moment.

I am a bit skeptical about this matter because this run is different than the years previously so I'm not sure the past years can be used much as indicators.

I do however know that institutions like to take the weekend off and rinse people when the week starts again. However this 14th is supposedly when the Fed will fully adopt ISO 20022 protocol which makes this... extra wild. 

Can they really pump that many alts though?

The only thing I have to indicate anything is that for some reason, Solana hasn't moved much and usually it moves a ton.

HBAR however is moving and it usually takes a lot to pump it upside.

This run is confusing to follow.",-0.299

2025-07-13 11:49:39,"How Restaked ETH is Being Used to Build a 'Supreme Court' for Crypto, Judging Everything from AI to Oracles For years, blockchains have excelled at enforcing objective truth: cryptographic, provable, indisputable. But as we push into richer domains like verifiable AI, decentralized social media, and advanced oracle networks, we’re hitting a wall. These new frontiers bring subjective questions that can’t be resolved by code alone.

This is where a new architectural pattern emerges: layered trust. At its core, it combines the hard guarantees of Ethereum with the flexibility of human judgment.

A leading example is the Verifiable Cloud (EigenCloud on @EigenLayer). Its security model has two distinct layers:

• Restaked ETH enforces objective rules — was the data posted? did the computation execute? — with automatic slashing for failure. No interpretation needed.
• EIGEN handles subjective disputes: was an oracle’s source reliable? did an AI’s output meet agreed standards? — via decentralized arbitration.

The brilliance lies in the separation of concerns. Ethereum’s validator set, amplified through restaking, forms an unshakable foundation. On top of this foundation, EIGEN provides a social layer for gray areas where algorithmic certainty ends and human discernment begins.

The ""slash-and-fork"" mechanism is key here. When disputes arise, stakers vote. Malicious actors are slashed; honest participants fork to the correct state. Crucially, this mechanism works because it inherits the economic weight of Ethereum. Without ETH’s security budget underpinning it, the system wouldn’t hold.

This is the crux: the subjective layer only has value because it’s anchored to Ethereum’s objective guarantees. This layered approach could unlock decentralized governance, AI moderation, and trust-minimized data services — all backed by the most battle-tested security in crypto.

It also reframes staking itself. No longer just a passive yield generator, restaked ETH becomes an active force, providing programmable trust to power the emerging verifiable internet.

If it works, we could see an entire class of oracles, AI agents, data-availability layers, and even rollups renting Ethereum’s security instead of bootstrapping their own. This composability makes ETH not just a currency or a commodity but the base layer for digital truth.

2025-07-13 09:17:23,"The Role of Memecoins in Today’s Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Memecoins—cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes and viral culture—have evolved from niche novelties to significant players in the cryptocurrency landscape. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and platforms like *Pump<>fun* exemplify their multifaceted impact. As of July 2025, memecoins continue to drive innovation, adoption, and market dynamics across various dimensions, despite their speculative nature. As you may know based on some of my comments and posts, I believe memecoins are a key driving force and they will continue to propel blockchain/CryptoCurrency innovations to audience that desire a soft landing platform to crypto. I have put together this post to portray key examples and recent developments.

## Driving User Adoption and Onboarding
Memecoins serve as an accessible entry point for new crypto users. Their low price points and viral appeal attract retail investors who might otherwise shy away from complex DeFi or NFT projects. Dogecoin, launched in 2013, gained mainstream traction through endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, peaking at a $90 billion market cap in 2021. Its simplicity—built on a Bitcoin fork—made it a gateway for millions to explore crypto wallets and exchanges. Similarly, Shiba Inu, an Ethereum-based token, onboarded users via its “Doge Killer” branding, reaching a $40 billion market cap in 2021. By 2025, Bonk on Solana has drawn thousands to its ecosystem, with its playful dog-themed narrative boosting Solana wallet creation by ~15% during its 2023 peak, ~ **source** Solana Foundation data.

Recent events, like Pump-fun’s $500 million PUMP token sale recently, highlight memecoins’ onboarding power. Pump-fun gamified launchpad, which enabled over 5 million meme token creations on Solana *[according to on-chain stats], attracted both creators and speculators, driving platform revenue to $715 million by mid-2025. This accessibility fosters broader crypto adoption, particularly among younger demographics.

## Boosting Blockchain Activity and Liquidity
Memecoins significantly increase transaction volumes and liquidity on their host blockchains. Dogecoin’s 2021 surge drove transaction spikes on its network, with daily volumes reaching 1.5 million transactions - [*Bitinfocharts*] . Shiba Inu’s trading on Ethereum contributed ~10-15% to the chain’s transaction volume during its 2021 peak, according to Dune Analytics. Bonk’s 2023 rise on Solana similarly boosted network activity [a period when many including holders like me were very skeptical about Solana future after many network halts and restarts], with daily transactions hitting 5million+ during its hype cycle. These surges elevate gas fees and validator revenue, strengthening blockchain economics.

Pumpdotfun success underscores this trend. Its Solana-based platform, with more than $20 million in monthly revenue as of July 2025, has increased SOL demand and liquidity. The PUMP token sale, selling 125 billion tokens in 12 minutes across major exchanges like Bybit and Kraken, amplified Solana’s market visibility, contributing to a ~20% market cap increase in Q2 2025, per CoinGecko.

## Fostering Innovation and Ecosystem Growth
- Memecoins spur innovation by encouraging developers to build supporting infrastructure. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem expanded to include ShibaSwap, a DEX, and NFT integrations, enhancing Ethereum’s DeFi landscape. Bonk’s success on Solana led to tools like PumpSwap, a DEX launched by Pump-fun in 2025, which shares 50% of trading revenue with token creators. This creator-friendly model has driven developer interest, with Solana’s dApp ecosystem growing more than 17% since Pump-d-fun’s January 2024 launch, - DappRadar.

- Memecoins also inspire novel mechanics. Pumps bonding curve model, where token prices rise as buys increase, and its liquidity-locking feature have set new standards for token launches, reducing rug pull risks. These innovations strengthen blockchain ecosystems, attracting more projects and users. A feature that many standalone blockchains lack even with today's crypto market awareness. 

## Cultural and Social Impact
Memecoins leverage internet culture to create and engaged communities, fostering loyalty and advocacy. Dogecoin’s “tipping” culture on platforms like Reddit built a grassroots following, while SHIB’s “SHIBArmy” drove social media hype, with over 1 million X[Twitter] followers by 2025. Bonk’s community-centric airdrops in 2023 revitalized Solana’s ecosystem post-FTX collapse, boosting morale and adoption.

## Challenges and Risks
Despite their benefits, memecoins pose risks too and it will be very silly to not acknowledge these risks. Their speculative nature fuels volatility—Pump*d*fun’s trading volume dropped 75-80% since January 2025 - *[DeFiLlama]*, reflecting market fickleness. Scams, like BSC’s Squid Game token rug pull in 2021, highlight vulnerabilities. Overreliance on memecoin hype can also skew blockchain development toward short-term gains, potentially deterring serious projects. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern, as memecoins’ speculative appeal could invite crackdowns, impacting broader markets.

## My take on memecoins
Memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and platforms like Pump-fun, etc are more than fleeting trends—they drive adoption, liquidity, innovation, and cultural engagement in the crypto ecosystem. While their volatility and risks warrant caution, their ability to onboard users, boost blockchain activity, and inspire new tools is undeniable. As of July 2025, memecoins remain a dynamic force, shaping cryptocurrency’s growth and mainstream appeal, with Pump-fun’s $500 million token sale vocalising their enduring impact. However, sustainable growth requires balancing their speculative allure with robust ecosystem development.",0.9989
2025-07-13 09:16:58,"The Partnership That Never Was: LINE denies partnership with PARAMETA and ICON ($ICX), now known as SODAX ($SODA) Disclaimer: I was the lead comms specialist for ICON Foundation for a few years since starting early 2018. However, I did not realize nor was I aware of any of the things during my tenure there. **[You can read the full article here.](https://medium.com/naxy/exposing-the-icon-parameta-lie-the-truth-behind-the-claimed-partnership-with-line-fba17f4e73a3)**

**TL;DR: I recently saws an article on coindesk about how ICON ($ICX) rebranded to SODAX ($SODA), and I thought this would be a good time to bring some awareness to the project so that people can make better informed decisions and investments.**

**ICON ($ICX) / SODAX ($SODA) and PARAMETA have claimed for years that LINE (Japan's massive messaging app) uses their blockchain technology. I emailed LINE directly to verify. LINE responded clearly stating they have ""absolutely no relationship"" with ICON or PARAMETA.**

It appears ICON used this alleged partnership to legitimize their project, attract investors, raise funds, and establish other ""empty"" partnerships. Additionally, ICON heavily promoted Blue Whale Foundation--a project that abruptly ceased operations after raising over $21 million USD during its ICO--with ICON/PARAMETA executives serving as the team advisors and getting compensated possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. Their recent rebranding to SODAX could be an attempt to distance themselves from these controversies and false promises. 

**Classic blockchain marketing tactic: claim big partnerships that don't materialize into anything, then rebrand when people catch on.**

- No actual collaboration with LINE: In October 2024, LINE’s blockchain team explicitly denied any relationship with ICON/PARAMETA, stating that assertions about loopchain integration into LINE’s LINK Chain are false.

- Strong marketing, weak follow-through: ICON and PARAMETA promoted multiple supposed partnerships (Samsung, SK Planet, Smilegate, etc.) and projects (like Blue Whale Foundation), which never materialized and/or raised millions of dollars only to cease operations overnight.

- Big-picture concern: These claims likely inflated perceived legitimacy--potentially misleading investors and the broader community.

- Strategic rebranding? ICON’s shift to SODAX ($SODA) appears timed to distract from past controversies, raising questions about motives behind the transformation.

- Call for transparency: The article urges ICON/SODAX and PARAMETA to provide verifiable evidence or issue clarifications to address these serious allegations. My calls for transparency and bringing awareness to the /r/helloicon community, a subreddit that I managed during its peak years, resulted in me getting permanently banned for ""FUD"" despite the fact that nothing I stated was false, deceptive, nor misleading. It was honestly a little surprising and sad to see a subreddit community that I helped grow and have it be an open forum for people to share genuine concerns and criticisms become into a dead subreddit where practically every user is banned (excluding the occasional posters that are just mods or paid p-reps). 

**You can read a more in-depth breakdown that I wrote in this article [here](https://medium.com/naxy/exposing-the-icon-parameta-lie-the-truth-behind-the-claimed-partnership-with-line-fba17f4e73a3).**

The contracts are fixed, it doesn't matter what the market does.

For example, you put in $15 contract and in 1 day you get back $15.60.  So, okay, 60 cents, whatever.

Or, on the other extreme, you put in a $50k contract and then in 45 days you get back 96k.  You double your 50k in 6 weeks???  I don't see how this is possible.

Can anyone shed any light on this?  I keep trying to figure out if this is a scam, or what is going on here.

There are a lot of major news outlets reporting on this startup, so it isn't just some random hacker making a website.  But, it really seems too good to be true.  I just want some proof one way or the other.

2025-07-13 01:09:07,"I need to understand. At what point does BTC become a rich man’s game and retail gets locked out again?

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and I’m genuinely confused. Wasn’t Bitcoin originally created to help the average person? 

To be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that bypasses traditional banking gatekeepers?

But here’s what I’m seeing:
	•	Transaction fees that can spike to $20+ during busy periods
	•	Lightning Network requiring technical knowledge most people don’t have
	•	Mining becoming dominated by massive industrial operations
	•	Institutional adoption driving prices to levels where a whole coin costs more than most people’s annual salary
	•	Self-custody requiring technical skills that intimidate regular users

I keep hearing that Bitcoin is “the best monetary system known to man” - and maybe it is from a technical standpoint. But if that’s true, why does it feel like we’re heading toward a system where only wealthy institutions and tech-savvy individuals can actually use it effectively?

The man on the street who Bitcoin was supposedly created for now needs:

	•	Expensive hardware wallets
	•	Deep technical knowledge of seed phrases, private keys, etc.
	•	Ability to navigate complex DeFi protocols
	•	Enough capital to make transaction fees worthwhile

Meanwhile, the same financial institutions that Bitcoin was meant to disrupt are now buying it up by the billions and potentially manipulating the market just like they do with everything else.
Am I missing something here? 

Is there actually a realistic path for regular people to use Bitcoin as intended, or are we just recreating the same exclusionary financial system with extra steps?

Would love to hear from people who’ve been in this space longer than me. Are there solutions I’m not seeing, or is this just the inevitable evolution of any successful monetary system?

TL;DR: Bitcoin feels like it’s becoming exactly what it was created to replace - a financial system that only works for the elite. Change my mind?",0.9936

Anyway rather than extract y'all for web traffic. I want to share my stuff directly on r/CryptoCurrency ...So here's a blog Ive been working on.



While everyone's circle-jerking over all-time highs, Congress is about to vote on three crypto bills that could quietly restructure the entire financial system:

* **GENIUS Act** — Regulates stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USD1)
* **CLARITY Act** — Defines what’s a commodity vs. a security
* **Anti-CBDC Act** — Bans the Fed from creating a digital dollar

# The GENIUS Act = Stablecoins Go Full TradFi

It turns “internet dollars” into fully regulated payment tools.

But here’s the kicker:  
**These coins are backed by U.S. Treasuries.**

Which means:

* Stablecoin adoption = more demand for U.S. debt
* Private issuers = indirect Treasury dealers
* U.S. gov gets funded, issuers get rich

>

This isn't innovation.  
**It's a debt machine with a crypto wrapper.**

# The CLARITY Act = Which Agency Gets to Regulate Your Bag

* CFTC → commodities
* SEC → securities

This bill defines the turf war — but don’t get it twisted:

**This isn’t about clarity for you. It’s about control for them.**

# The Anti-CBDC Act = Fed Banned from Digital Currency

This one straight-up bans the Fed from launching a CBDC.

No FedCoin.  
No public digital dollar.  
Just *private* stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and USD1.

>

No Fed control = no monetary sovereignty.  
Welcome to privatized money.

# The New System:

* **USD1** = MAGA coin
* **Tether + Circle** = digital dollar issuers
* **Treasuries** = the new backing
* **You** = still the exit liquidity

This isn’t decentralization.  
**It’s the Fed getting phased out by politicians with  stable coins.**

Do not follow guides posted to anyone's user profile. **TL;DR - People who post like ordinary Redditors have scam guides in their user profiles. They want to steal money from ordinary people by pretending to be ordinary people.**                     

Quick forenote: This is **not** the ""I made 230 dollars in one day"" scam where another user gets tagged in the OP.                  

**If you encounter this kind of scammer** Please report the user and use a ""custom report option"" and then write something like ""Scam guide in user profile."" or ""This is a scammer, check their profile.""                   

Problem encountered: I saw a post that was written in a way to gain everyone's favor. It had more than 50, but less than 100 upvotes, and looked like it was any other post. The OP even asked what coins they should look into. But then a user reported the post, encouraging us to look into the user's profile. The scam posted was well-written, but had some red flags. ""Send 100 USD of eth to this wallet address and you'll get 101 USD of Eth back."" For those of you who don't know, the comments that are posted to the guide are all fake. The comments all say, ""Wow this worked. I can do this 9 times more today."" They take your crypto and run once it is sent.                  

#IMPORTANT: Do NOT write in the comments anything inflammatory to the scammer. If they know we are on to them, this could cause them to remove the posts from their profiles and then repost them on another day - turning this into a game of ""scammer whack-a-mole.""",-0.3291

The scene shows a messy work area, a map, a calendar and other paraphernalia is seen in the background. the camera angle is positioned so it is tilted slightly upwards and shows ‘Joe Exotic’ from Tiger King looming in the shot with a look of distress and deflation. On the top section of the meme the text reads ‘BTC loses 0.75% value’. The character of Joe Exotic has a poorly edited label ‘Altcoin’ overlaid his face.

2025-07-12 01:32:20,"Why the Genius Act is positive for crypto The GENIUS Bill might be one of the most positive moves for crypto in the U.S. in a long time. It brings much-needed regulatory clarity by clearly defining what digital assets are — separating decentralized projects from traditional securities. That alone would help reduce the fear that builders and investors have of surprise SEC crackdowns. It also protects developers, validators, and node operators from being treated like financial intermediaries, which is huge for keeping DeFi and open-source development alive.

What really stands out is the bill’s support for decentralization and innovation. It even proposes a “safe harbor” period for new projects, giving them space to grow without immediately getting caught in regulatory crosshairs. It’s not about letting scams run free — fraud is still very much in the crosshairs — but it is about making the U.S. a better place to build real crypto projects. It’s not law yet, but it’s a step in the right direction.

Then I swapped the sol for pengu and 4 separate pengu's showed up in my wallet 1 with the amount I had swapped and 3 with with $2000 worth in.
I clicked on one, and when to swap to see what happened. When I clicked the max amount a yellow box popped up and said there was a issue.
Then I realised the 3 pengu's and the meme coin had slightly different spellings. so obviously scam coins.

Backed by Eric Schmidt (ex-Google CEO), built by ex-Nano devs, and designed to kill SWIFT.

🔍 What is Keeta?
Keeta is a next-gen Layer 1 blockchain and fintech protocol designed from the ground up to serve as the institutional-grade financial settlement layer of the future.
With 10M+ TPS, sub-second deterministic finality, and native KYC/AML compliance, Keeta is not just another crypto project—it's a full-stack replacement for SWIFT and traditional banking rails.

💡 What Makes Keeta Different?
* 10M+ TPS, <0.4s finality, $0.00005 fees
* Horizontally scalable: more nodes = more throughput (like Google Cloud infra)
* Client-driven consensus: voting happens before hitting the network = ultra low latency
* Every account is its own chain – enables true parallel processing (pseudo-DAG architecture)
* Built-in KYC/AML compliance – Travel Rule, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 20022
* Supports private subnets, asset restrictions, and bank-grade permission systems

👥 Who’s Behind It?
* Ty Schenk (CEO) – ex-Nano ecosystem dev
* Roy Keene (CTO) – Nano’s former lead dev
* Eric Schmidt invested $17M, calling it his biggest blockchain bet to date
* Branding by Red Antler (Chime, Ramp, Hinge)

📅 What’s Coming?
* Mainnet launch: Summer 2025
* Independent 10M TPS benchmark
* Reveal of stablecoin provider
* Launch of Anchors (cross-chain & fiat bridges)
* Native DEX and KeetaPay v2 relaunch

💸 Token Quick Info
* Token: $KTA
* Supply: 1B total, 400M circulating
* Launch: Fair launch on Ethereum L2 (Base)
* Market Cap: ~$300M – same as a memecoin 🙃

Keeta isn't another L1 copycat. It’s a fully compliant, massively scalable financial protocol built for real-world adoption. This is infrastructure-level tech—way beyond hype.

2025-07-11 01:12:26,"Altcoin Rally and Altseason Signals [Chart showing BTC\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/dt68cslma5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd87a01908addf934ee0739d749c95a788ab8ea5)

As Bitcoin breaks its all-time high again and Ethereum begins to show meaningful rebound trends, the market's focus naturally shifts to the anticipation of whether the altcoin market will now catch fire. However, one must remember that the market's structure operates in contexts beyond mere price rises. The phenomenon known as altseason is not defined by a few specific coins rising; the key lies in how funds flow and how market participants interpret that flow. The current phase seems closer to a period of checking the potential for a shift in capital rotation rather than a short-term rally.

  

# Understanding Bitcoin Dominance as an Altcoin Rally Signal

 

[Chart showing Bitcoin Dominace](https://preview.redd.it/aazyf58qa5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb779ebd45319266c2e76f8bc3231b05e3e06b7)

 

The first criterion for judging market structure is Bitcoin dominance. This indicator distinguishes whether liquidity entering the market is staying solely in Bitcoin or gradually moving to Ethereum and altcoins. A true altseason occurs when funds progressively flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to mid- and small-cap altcoins.

If Bitcoin's dominance forms a peak and turns downward, it can be interpreted as a signal that funds seeking higher returns are starting to move to other sectors. Recently, despite Bitcoin's new highs, dominance has been stagnating or slightly declining, which appears to be a turning point worth watching closely. If this trend persists, it's hard to ignore the possibility that the market's balance is tilting toward altcoins.

 

# The Role of ETH/BTC Ratio in Altseason Signals

 

[Chart showing ETH\/BTC](https://preview.redd.it/y854kmzva5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=338d35e096bce3d26ee605999cef06bf53db2ade)

 

In the same vein, the ETH/BTC ratio plays a crucial role. The real starting point of altseason has always coincided with the rise of this ratio. When Ethereum begins to show strength against Bitcoin, the market accepts it as a signal of structural recovery. This is not just because of its position as the second-largest by market cap, but because Ethereum serves as a central hub connecting DeFi, L2, NFT, and infrastructure ecosystems. Ethereum's strength implies more than just price; it suggests the recovery of demand across the entire alt market.

If the ETH/BTC ratio consolidates at the bottom and continues its rebound, it could be seen as a clear 'first confirmation signal,' providing investors with reason to reassess their altcoin portfolios.

 

# Broader Market Factors Influencing Altcoin Rallies

That said, it's still too early to draw firm conclusions. While funds concentrating in some thematic altcoins are detectable, it's hard to view this as spreading to the entire market. For instance, the recent rises in tokens related to AI, RWA, and DePIN are closer to localized rallies driven by specific narratives rather than a broad alt market uptrend. For an environment worthy of being called altseason to form, widespread concurrent rises must appear across Ethereum-based projects, neglected mid- and small-cap chains, various L1 and L2 ecosystems, and thematic DeFi and NFT projects. Particularly, without accompanying recovery in trading volume and on-chain metrics, the market is unlikely to sustain on short-term expectations alone—a critical perspective is needed here. These indicators serve as keys to gauging market health, steering away from fixation on mere price fluctuations.

Moreover, altseason has always emerged in market cycles after Bitcoin's stable rally. In phases where Bitcoin repeats sharp ups and downs, funds seek stability, which acts as poison to the alt market. Conversely, when BTC stabilizes at a certain high or enters a sideways phase, market participants then turn to risk assets for greater returns, and that's when the altcoin market starts to stir. **The current situation being merely the 'initial stage of fund movement' suggests that excessive optimism should be guarded against.**

 

# External Economic Triggers Like US Rate Cuts

 

[Fed Rate Cut Probabilities from CME FedWatch Tool: Essential Signals for Anticipating Altcoin Rally in H2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/vzyaq610b5cf1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddfe4135c1da0757d53483a0dd29cf7f5e82521)

 

If expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, signs of liquidity re-expansion, and tech stock-led stock market rises align, a full-fledged risk-on flow could form in the cryptocurrency market as well. In such a case, funds are likely to flow sequentially beyond Bitcoin to ETH and the entire altcoin market. **Especially, with institutional funds accessing the market through various channels like stablecoins and BlackRock ETFs, the current flow creates an environment where altseason can be designed on a foundation entirely different from the past**. While these external factors can promote structural changes in the market, considering that their effects may not be immediate calls for flexibility in investment strategies.

Bitcoin's current movements are not significant on the surface. Amid fluctuations of around 2%, it even shows patterns of digesting selling volume in a box range retest phase. Observing whether small buys are gradually entering in this range or if selling resumes at resistance levels is more important. Real bull markets often create vertical rises without giving time to buy. If the market is giving time for many to ponder support and resistance and worry about corrections, it also means it's still early. In other words, it's not too late. Rather, if meaningful corrections emerge in this process, that point could become a buying opportunity. Strategies focusing on accumulating spot positions in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple remain valid. Full-fledged rallies usually start not after people's convictions form, but while doubts linger.

While Bitcoin shows volatility of 1-3% per day, opportunities are more frequently observed on the altcoin side. Especially since the overall market hasn't entered an overheated phase on a spot basis, strategies to accumulate positions in such phases may be reasonable. More important than short-term fluctuations is where funds are residing and in which direction they are moving. This could be the starting point of that transition.

 

[Chart of the Altcoin Season Index](https://preview.redd.it/76b8u665b5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=75411e89903e8db99b9a9453cd790560bf48084b)

 

Of course, the futures market now offers environments for significant profits. But looking back at past flows, in phases where bull markets fully materialize, investors maintaining consistent spot portfolios often recorded higher returns. Short-term trading is a means to maximize momentary profits, but when the market starts riding a structural uptrend, long-term holding strategies can work more advantageously. This is even more so in phases where market vitality is reviving like now.

Particularly, fixating on daily charts, immersing in daily market updates on cafes or communities, or relying on overly amplified macroeconomic analyses to time buys often leads to getting caught in FOMO psychology. But the market doesn't wait for such interpretations or predictions. Directions don't change immediately just because rates rise slightly or inflation stabilizes somewhat, and in fact, Bitcoin has broken new highs amid such debates. This approach may seem analytical on the surface, but in reality, it tends to lead to fixation on instant profits, pushing oneself into increasingly unstable states. Above all, even when the market starts to grasp a full direction at crucial points, most are not prepared to ride that flow.

A single trading mistake can damage an account, or conversely, missing one opportunity can leave one watching the entire bull market from the sidelines. Given that the current market environment favors structural and long-term strategies more, taking such risks seems unwarranted. Reflecting back, investors who consistently held spot or some futures from April onward would now be in sufficient profit zones. The likelihood is high that this yielded far better results than repeated frantic trading daily. Ultimately, attempts to time the market often lead to frequent failures, **whereas those riding structural uptrends gain the effects of compounding through time and direction. Approaches that are not sustainable or recoverable can become causes for pushing oneself out of the market even in bull phases.**

For some, this phase may be a time to prepare for new opportunities, while for others, it could be interpreted as a section to trim positions or reduce risks. But what's important is clearly establishing one's strategy and building a portfolio accordingly. While it's not yet possible to assert what flow's starting point this is, it seems sufficient timing as preparation to close out the fourth quarter of this year with meaningful profits. Approach it with a strategic perspective, without being too hasty but without missing the flow.

2025-07-10 16:47:34,"FUUUUUUSAKA – Ethereums next upgrade Wow, what a successful Pectra upgrade, which allowed everyone to see lowest gas fees, improved data efficiency as increased decentralization. But what’s next for Ethereum… it’s the Fusaka upgrade!

Fusaka is expected to be implemented Q4 2025 or early in 2026 and it will pretty much pick up from where Pectra left off.

# Expected upgrades in Fusaka

https://preview.redd.it/q7bay968t2cf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=248258d9e514f1866605cd98e8ae4ea43a1c6c31

This list is subject to change and there may be more EIPs added or removed as we get closer to the release date!

In my opinion, below are upgrades that are important to me that I am excited to look forward to!!!

**Verkle Trees**… Pectra upgrade pretty set up Fusaka for releasing Verkle Trees which are wayyyyyy more efficient of a data structure than the current Merkle Patricia Trees. Verkle trees will allow the Ethereum nodes so they can continue to validate blocks without storing an enormous amount of state data.

# TANGENT TIME!

Like who the hell do they come up with these names? I didn’t know so I had to look it up haha.

Patricia is the Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric.

Merkle Tree is used in cryptography due to the ability of creating a verifiable correlation of all data pieces of a tree which will result in one, single root value to prove the data!

Therefore… Merkle Patricia Tree is both cryptographically verifiable and deterministic! Per the Ethereum foundation

The only way to generate a state root is by computing it from each individual piece of the state, and two states that are identical can be easily proven so by comparing the root hash and the hashes that led to it (*a Merkle proof*)

Verkle trees was named by blending the sound and/or meaning of 2 words: ""Merkle Trees"" and ""Vector commitment"".

Now that we know the naming convention of the current and future Trees, lets continue!

Verkle Trees will be more efficient, enable stateless clients, while making Ethereum lighter, faster, and even more decentralized!

# I’m also looking forward to PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling)!

We saw the blob improvements in the Pectra upgrade and we should expect more in the Fusaka upgrade. Blob sampling will be further improved for rollups, data availability will be enhanced without affecting the node burden, Layer 2s will be further scaled up, and will future-proof Ethereum’s data availability layer. HELL YEAH!

# A third upgrade I am excited for is the EVM Object Format (EOF).

EOF will streamline the process for how smart contracts are created and executed! Essentially, Predictability, gas efficiency, and security will be improved for developers which will affect all users on the blockchain!

Think of Fusaka as Ethereum’s “deep clean and upgrade” phase, polishing the internals of the protocol for long-term future-proof growth. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",0.9969

2025-07-10 08:45:14,"What the typical crypto investor doesn’t understand is that ETH is the gravitational center of the Ethereum system No matter what scaling solution you look at: rollups, validiums, or EigenLayer-enabled systems like MegaETH, everything still ultimately anchors back to onchain Ether.

* Rollups settle their state roots on Ethereum L1, secured by validators who stake ETH and paid for with Ether-denominated fees.
* Validiums keep data offchain but rely on Ethereum to verify proofs, secured again by ETH-staked validators.
* EigenLayer extends Ethereum’s security to new services by restaking ETH itself, making Ether the direct collateral securing new decentralized systems.

No matter how modular the architecture becomes, ETH will remain where value accrues, and what ties everything together.

Yet despite Ether’s central role in scalability, the proliferation of Ethereum scalability solutions has not resulted in a flood of demand for ETH.

The reason is simple: Ethereum’s scalability solutions are still immature. The onchain statistics demonstrate this:

* Ethereum mainnet holds about $121 billion in total value locked.
* The largest Layer 2 solution, Base, holds only about $2 billion — less than 2% of mainnet’s TVL.

The market overwhelmingly still trusts Mainnet. Rollups, restaking, and other modular systems are early in their lifecycle, still earning credibility in security, uptime, and adoption.

As these layers mature and the market gains confidence, more value will migrate outward, but it will remain anchored in Ether.

If Ethereum’s modular scaling roadmap is successfully executed, then orders of magnitude more economic activity will occur on modular extensions of Ethereum than on Mainnet, and in such a scenario, the demand that these extensions will generate for ETH will become appreciable.

This is my first ever token. I launched it today using Vercel just to see if I could actually build something that worked. And now it’s live:

	•	Supply: Fixed
	•	No taxes, no pre-sale, no rug
	•	Liquidity burned
	•	Ownership renounced

Honestly, I think it’s about taking power back. Everyone believes in money, so they make it real. I say fuck the banks and the dudes with all the money bags. Let’s make our own shit and make that real. That’s BruhCoin.

Crypto started as a rebellion. Lately it feels like it’s full of suits and scams. This is me trying to bring back some of the old spirit. No gatekeepers. No overlords. Just people deciding together what has value.

And let’s be real — if you’ve ever stared at your wallet after a 99% dump and whispered “bruh…” — this coin’s for you.

If this gets some traction, I’ll build out fun features. Maybe meme bounties, maybe voting on wild ideas, maybe just a shrine to bad trades. If it dies, it dies. But if it flies? That’s our win.

Styrian Man Defrauded of Hundreds of Thousands of Euros

A 22-year-old man from Eastern Styria has fallen victim to a cryptocurrency scam, losing €588,000. The young man attempted to withdraw profits from cryptocurrencies and gave unknown perpetrators access to his digital wallet. Police are now investigating.

Online since yesterday, 11:15 AM

The 22-year-old began investing in cryptocurrencies in 2021 after receiving an inheritance. Within two years, he had invested several hundred thousand euros and even moved to Dubai to focus on crypto trading.

In November 2022, he attempted to withdraw €20,000 via a peer-to-peer transaction on an international trading platform. This brought him into contact with the alleged scammers. In English-language phone calls and chats, he was asked to provide personal information and account details.

A peer-to-peer transaction in the crypto world refers to a method in which two individuals exchange cryptocurrencies directly, without relying on banks, exchanges, or a central server as an intermediary.

Access to Wallet via Recovery Code

Through a phishing link, the Styrian man was directed to a supposed support chat, where he was asked to verify his identity. His critical mistake was revealing the recovery code for his crypto wallet.

""With this code, the criminals gained access to the victim's entire crypto wallet. They were able to siphon off a total of €588,000 and subsequently transfer it to numerous accounts,"" according to the police report.

Police Warn Against Sharing Recovery Codes

Police are now investigating the unknown perpetrators, who, based on experience, are usually located abroad. IT experts from the police strongly warn against ever disclosing recovery codes.

""This is not standard procedure, even in legitimate cryptocurrency withdrawals,"" investigators emphasized. They also advise against allowing remote access and recommend enabling additional security measures like multi-factor authentication for ",-0.5574

Fast forward to 2019, ten years later, and Bitcoin was already gaining mainstream attention. The btc price around that time? About $3,000 to $10,000, depending on the month. It's still affordable compared to today, but many of us, including myself, watched from the sidelines.  
  
By 2020, Bitcoin was everywhere,  Twitter/X, YouTube, the news etc, it was almost impossible to ignore. And yet, many of us still did. I saw the noise, but didn’t act on it.   


Today, btc price is sitting around $100,000 to $109,000, depending on the market. It’s no longer an underground idea. It’s a global asset class, talked about by governments, banks, and your average person on the street. The climb has been unreal and we all saw the signs.

2025-07-09 14:56:55,"Crypto Settlement Times - Visual Comparison Tool For Crypto Settlement Times Cryptocurrency settlement times, or time to finality, are essential to understand. They tell you how long it takes for a cryptocurrency transaction to be verified and considered irreversible on the blockchain.

For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use probabilistic finality, confirmations are about reducing the probability of a transaction reversal. Each confirmation means more blocks are added to the chain after your transaction, making it increasingly difficult to alter. While absolute certainty is never reached, the chance of reversal becomes astronomically low with each confirmation. Bitcoin, for example, commonly uses 6 confirmations, with each block taking roughly 10 minutes, to reach a very high level of confidence in transaction finality.

However, not all cryptocurrencies work this way. Some, like Nano, offer deterministic finality. Here, a ""confirmation"" signifies a definitive agreement within the network, achieved through different consensus mechanisms. Once confirmed in a deterministic system, the transaction is considered absolutely final and irreversible.",0.0698

I recently launched a token on Solana as part of a broader experiment I’m working on — tied to an on-chain AI agent project (currently in beta).

The tech side is exciting, but I’ve realized launching a token is the *easy* part. What’s proving way harder is getting real traction: volume, community interest, and trust  especially in a market that’s hypersensitive to rugs and noise.

Right now I’m relying on:

– Organic DMs and slow growth via X

– Memes and wallet tracking content

– A waitlist and soft beta testing  


But I want to ask you all directly:

**If you’ve launched or supported a token before, what actually helped move the needle?**



* Was it a specific community angle?
* Incentives or airdrops?
* Collaborations or KOL backing?
* Something else entirely?

1) A few billion in inflows from Treasuries or corporate cash reserves is tiny compared to the total fiat parked in low-yield assets.

2) MicroStrategy is obviously the biggest buyer but who's next? Apple? Meta? Tesla doubling down? Even a few percent of S&P 500 treasury cash moving into BTC (we’re talking tens of billions) could slingshot Bitcoin to $500K+.

3) BTC market cap right now  aprox $1.3T. A $100B inflow (a rounding error of global institutional wealth) could double the price due to low float and hodl hodl chants.

Here’s Why Hey everyone, I’ve been watching the markets closely and I’ve got a theory that might go against the current sentiment: the real crypto bull market hasn’t started yet. What we’re seeing in Bitcoin’s price action so far might not actually be appreciation it could be protection. Let me explain.


Bitcoin’s “Gains” Might Be Illusionary Driven by USD Weakness

Yes, Bitcoin is up significantly in USD terms. But is that because BTC is genuinely appreciating in value, or is it because the USD is rapidly depreciating due to macro factors?

The Fed has quietly pivoted. Rate cuts are expected, and the dollar index (DXY) is showing extreme weakness.

Massive stimulus and deficit spending are ramping up again, especially ahead of elections. Add to that the growing trade tensions and tariffs and you’ve got more fear of monetary instability.

In that context, Bitcoin is functioning as a flight-to-safety asset a hedge against a shaky fiat system rather than starting its real parabolic cycle. This isn’t euphoria. It’s fear.

ALSO Alts Haven’t Moved Classic Sign the Bull Run Hasn’t Really Begun

One of the clearest signs we’re not yet in a full blown bull market? Alts are still asleep.

Historically, altcoin pumps follow Bitcoin dominance peaking.

Right now, Bitcoin dominance is still high, and liquidity is largely centralized in BTC/ETH.

Retail hasn’t piled in yet. Google Trends, TikTok hype, and social momentum are nothing like what we saw in 2017 or even 2021.

This feels like the “smart money accumulation” phase, not the middle of a euphoric cycle.

The Four-Year Cycle Is Just Getting Started

We’re only a few months past the 2024 halving. Historically, it takes about 6–12 months post-halving for the explosive move to happen.

2013: Halving Nov 2012 → Parabola mid/late 2013

2017: Halving July 2016 → Peak end of 2017

2021: Halving May 2020 → Run-up end of 2020 into 2021

This time I made extra sure the address was correct and initially it was showing sent to CN7865K7jCPzZXoqoBdQCxvNaHdncWNTsb6b5nteehSr the address then updated to GJ74g6e8wyYGswCcXdqWUywwiaxvNMi71bXAk38N22Kh again.

I then tried a small test transaction to myself. The address then updated from my own to: BQMhW9YrocHymWdEpL6oo4WoBsue7jrPuyd1qHV2UzVz  
  
Then I tried sending another test transaction to myself on another device that exodus in installed on again address updated to BQMhW9YrocHymWdEpL6oo4WoBsue7jrPuyd1qHV2UzVz

  
So it seems whatever is going on isn't limited to one device.. 

  
The only think I can think off that may have compromised me is that I was looking at a service called [zebec.io](http://zebec.io) and stupidly used wallet connect this was 5-6 days ago other than that I don't know how I could have been compromised. Can anyone advise me on what's going on? I have a fair bit of $ in the wallet so yeah. :/
