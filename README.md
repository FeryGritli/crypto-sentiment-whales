# Crypto Sentiment and Whale Activity: Lag-Lead Dynamics between Retail and Large Players

This project explores how retail sentiment (from Reddit, Twitter, and news from Cryptopanic) and whale activity (large on-chain transactions) interact in the crypto marketâ€”focusing on BTC, ETH, SOL, and USDT. We analyze whether whale actions lead or follow crowd mood, and how we can use sentiment to predict Whales activity.


**Project Structure:**
- `data/raw`: Original datasets
- `data/cleaned`: Cleaned, processed data
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `presentation`: Slides and visuals for sharing results
- `reports`: Written summaries and findings
- `src`: Python scripts for scraping, cleaning, analysis

**Key Features:**
- Sentiment extraction from social and news data
- Whale activity tracking and time-alignment by coin
- Aggregation, rolling averages, and visualization
- Lag-lead and causality analysis between sentiment and whales

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Place your raw data in `data/raw/`.  
   Use scripts in `src/` to clean/process as needed.
3. Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for EDA, visualization, and lag-lead analysis.

**Example Outputs:**  
- Coin-level plots of sentiment and whale moves over time  
- Heatmaps and statistics for lag/lead relationships  
- Summary tables for causality analysis
